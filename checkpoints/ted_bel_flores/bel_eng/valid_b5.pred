(Arab) I'm looking at Alah's refuge from Satan, in the name Alah, compassionate and compassionate.
I was born in a middle class family.
That's why I was so frustrated.
My mother was born 16 children.
From 16 children, only five were alive.
Imagine what my childhood was.
Every day, I saw women who were looking for love or kids who were going to visit the gallins.
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children.
Unfortunately, in my country, there wasn't Internet for girls, so I was accepted to school, but I couldn't visit it.
And my father sent me to America.
I went to America.
I finished my education.
When I learned, my country came the Russian military.
You know when I went to college, I didn't even know what happened with my family and with my country.
There were months, years, but I didn't know anything.
My family was in refugees camps.
So when I finished learning, I transported my family to America.
I wanted them to live in security.
Where was my heart?
My heart was in Afghanistan.
I had a good job.
I've learned to the university.
And then I went to the refugee camp.
When I went to that camp in Pakistan, I saw 7,5 million refugees, 7,5 million refugees.
About 90 percent of them were women and children, and most men were murdered or murdered, and you know when I was in refugees camps.
When I've done every day questions, I've sent things you can't imagine.
I saw a success with 5-8 kids sitting and crying, and she didn't know what to do.
I saw a young woman who couldn't go anywhere, had no education, no distractions that had even a room for life.
It was a very abrupt situation.
At that moment, we talk about impuls.
"And then I asked myself, ""What can I do for these people?""
How can I help them?
At that moment, I realized that education changed my life.
She changed me, and she gave me status.
At that moment, I realized that I had to give my people education and health, and I started working on it.
Do you think I was easy?
Not because at that moment, education was completely distracted by girls.
"The problem was to come and say, ""I want to do that."" Who's I?"
Have you believed me? Naturally, not.
That's why I had to install a trust in this community.
How did I do that?
I was looking at, and I was looking at.
I tried.
He was 80 years old.
He was humiliated.
"And he looked at me, and he said, ""Laughter, woman, girl. How can I become a teacher?"" And I said to him, ""I'm going to do a teacher."" And finally, he said, and when I started talking to his idea, the news began to spread."
Every year, we had 25 schools, and 15,000 children who were home to these schools, and it was amazing.
Naturally, we work, we encourage teachers, we teach women's rights, human rights, principles of democracy, justice, and we're doing different training. And then, I'm going to tell you.
One time, I was in a office in Beijing, Pakistan.
"And then I've seen how my employees walk to the room, open the doors and call me, ""Hey, house!"" If you're the leader you do?"
You're assaulted. You know that it's dangerous.
You know that your life is on the corner.
But as a leader, you have to be strong.
You have to marry and show power.
So I asked them to me.
They came. They've found tattoos.
I asked them to sit, and I offered their robots.
They refused, and they said that they're not going to drink.
Of course, their tone, the voice they talked with me, really loved me, and I really trossed.
But I was strong, it was hard.
"They said, ""What do you do?"
My colleagues started to go to the office.
They've been trying to open customers.
They worked with my mother and children.
We've conducted training about women's health.
We've conducted all the training you can only imagine.
I was happy, and I was happy with the results of my work.
Four coaches, one protector, and I went from Kabul, and again, unexpectedly, we stopped the center of 19 young people.
With bees on the flowers, they put us the way.
And this time, all of us are dying."
We know where you've been going.
All went home, nobody left.
I had only a protector, and I lost my voice.
There were hundreds of women to get education.
Well, I was sitting and surprised, and at that moment, we talk about impuls, and at that moment one of my wonderful donors was talking about the job.
"And she asked, ""Laughter?"" I said to her."
Today, these people are my best coaches.
And ... (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
It shows that education can change people.
I live in a country that was beautiful and good.
I want to share with you.
We could go where we wanted.
Do you know what happened to my country?
Today, people can't come out of their home, and they can't look at security.
But we want to return to our old Afghanistan.
They get diplomas, and they're learning on interviews.
He said that with compassion and love, you can create a world.
Superficiency: What do you want?
Client: Gmm, let's look.
SERVER: I'm going to make a broken patch, that's patched by the best coded data, two-coded crops, a battery with an operational, a CFC white chips, to this room with a polymorphic pollination shelves, and a coded crops.
Client: I want to buy a battery with an operational memory, and buy it's a bit of your best hair code.
SERVER: What's the room?
We have a huge high-performance data.
Client: Don't give a collection of robots if you want.
SERVER: It's the fastest.
I'm fast serving your order.
(Applause) My Pen: I'm painting with your couple how I learned to keep the voice in my hand, and I'm painting multiple characters in childhood from a third-year-old age.
And then I learned who were these animators.
On the TV, they showed a profession program that most kids don't know.
"And when I realized that animators are those who do computers that I'm going to look on the screen, I just said, ""I want to be animator!"" I don't know whether I realized that, or myself, but it was a big major moment of my life."
The image of animations and art was always my favorite things.
"And the interest in computer technologies created the idea of creating the animation ""The Golden Walls."" ("Malicious Dishes," so that's the beginning) I had a virus on my computer, and I tried to see it, and suddenly I thought, and what if there was my little world in the virus in the middle of the computer?"
Maybe there's any scale where they're going to be able to publish together?
"So they were born, ""The Golden Pain.""
When I was four years old, my father showed me how to pick up a computer on parts and build it again.
So I felt hard to computer technologies.
I built my first online computer in HTML, and now I learned JavaScript and Python languages.
"And I'm also developing a new animation called ""Applause."" It's about bees and other researchers who are in the universe, and why they're useful."
If the flowers didn't look at these detectors, all the things that were dependent on plant would be really dead with voice.
So I decided to use these file creation and do their super heroes team.
(Applause) (Applause of foot) (Music) (Applause) Askers: Ablause! Who's another!
You need to call the rest of the aspirants.
(Music) Thank you. (Applause) All of my animations started with the idea, but what are the ideas?
These ideas can inspire their hands.
These ideas are compassion and new development.
Because of the idea, the world is really cool.
If we don't have ideas, we would not be where we're now, there were no technical or medical results, there were no art, culture, our lifestyle.
"When I was eight years old, I took my ideas and I opened the company ""My idea,"" and there was a foundation ""My idea for the planet.""
(Laughter) I produce an ecological connection and oxygenators.
I'm now 13, and even though I started with a company in 2008, my artist's development started earlier.
Great impact on me always showed art, and I wanted to help him to everything I did, including my company.
And when we've got a little bit different, I thought that I could make a piece or a piece — I had so many ideas to make a material.
"And I noticed that when I made my products, I stopped on the street with a question, "How beautiful. Where can I buy it?""
And I thought that I could do this and open a company.
Because I was only eight years old, I didn't have any special plans to develop a company.
I just knew I wanted to produce beautiful things that would not lose the environment, and I wanted to share with those who had less than I spent in my life.
My mother taught me to write, and I was sitting back to home, and I made links to the head of the strip, and I wrote the name and the price for each of my products.
I started to create more products like shops, shakes and shakes.
My product started to buy around the world, and I found customers in Denmark, Italy, Australia, Canada and other countries.
And I realized, I had three things to learn about management of things like, for example, corporate name and sales, how to support customer relationships and monitor what's done better or worse.
The small company started to grow.
"And once I was 10 years old, I was talking to Forbes."
(Laughter) They wanted to write about me and my company in their classroom.
So many people ask me, why have I biotechnology products?
With a small age, I've been really interested in the environment and the creation that they live.
My parents ran learning me to share with those who were less compassionate, and with mind and willing to go to the environment.
I learned that textiles or even the process would produce things that are dangerous for people and planet, and I started my research, and I found that even after coloring there was a problem for the environment in what I didn't know what to do with the problems.
With the rest of the process of coloring, or with the rest, the most dry color.
It contaminates the air, making it taxable for everyone and everyone who respirates them.
So when I started with a company, I knew two things: all my products have to be ecological, and that 10-20 percent of my income should be offered to local and global well-being organizations.
(Applause) I think I'm part of the new call of entrepreneurs who don't just want to pay money, but also hope for sustainable development of the world.
I believe that I can drive my customers, and I'm alone going to be able to make the future generations to live more greenly reinforced lives.
We live in a big, different and beautiful world, and then I'm going to pay more to protect it.
Imagine what happens in the world only through my head and my minds is not enough.
You need to get everything through the heart, because it's then the idea of organization to drive hands.
Just then, compassion and inventions see the world, so ideas do reality.
Thank you all for measure and happiness.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Pete Mitchell: You've heard how I talked about my parents who are this magic woman. Where are they?
Please, Pan's compassion and compassion, you can ... You.
(Applause)
Here's a few findings of the connectivity of galaxies.
The name is really identical to the reality.
They're managed by these amazing collections of galaxies that are connected to each other with a collective gravitation.
The most corner you see on the screen is not the only stars, but the collection of stars or galaxies.
Now, showing you some of these findings, I hope you soon see that the fusion of galaxies is not just a beautiful object, but more than that, I think the fusion of galaxies is mysterious, they're sure, and they're useful.
They are critical as the source of the most powerful laboratory universe.
And in your role as a laborator, the assumption of combinations means the assumption of experiments you can perform over them.
I think there are four key types, and the first type that you want to inform is that it's in the context of something very big.
Well, how big is it?
Well, it's the discovery of one concrete connectivity of galaxies.
It's so massive that the light that passes through it is invented by the extreme gravitation of this connection.
And when you look very carefully, you're going to see the circles around the universe.
In order to not be vocal, it's the same combination of galaxies that has more than one million billion sun.
It's absolutely how massive these systems can be.
But more than that, they have an additional particularity.
They are the essence of isolated systems, and if you hope, we can think of them as a minor version of the entire universe.
"And on a lot of questions that can happen in us about the global world, for example, ""How does gravitation work?""
You'll be able to answer by studying these systems.
Well, that's what we've been talking about the amazing number.
The second type is that things are very cool.
So if you take a picture of the connectivity of galaxies, and you take all the light that comes out by stars, then this big, blue steep will remain.
It's a wrong coller.
What we see here is, in fact, the Renaissance light.
So the question is, if it's not the galaxies that change this light?
And the answer will be a hot gas, a million degrees gas, it's actually plasm.
And the beginning of this garden can be found on the first side.
The extreme gravitation of these systems connects the gas flow and gives them a huge speed, and the massive speed, at the same time, is a high temperature.
That's the key sense, but it's just science.
There are also a lot of other particles of this plasma, which, even though it's a voice for us, actually blows us, and it's a moment that stresses our understanding of the physics of the above-tuning goals.
Third is learning very little.
To tell you about this, I need to tell me about the troubling fact.
Most of the universe's mathematics are not done from atoms.
You've been manipulated.
Most of us are composed of something very mysterious that we call dark material.
Dark material is something that isn't really good to interact, except the cost of gravitation, and then we're going to pay to learn more about it.
If you're interested in physics, you're interested in what happens when we call something about each other.
And dark material is not an exception.
How can we do that?
"If I answer this question, I'm going to answer something different, "What's going to happen if the combinations of galaxies happen?""
Let's look at the picture.
We remember that the galaxic combinations are like the brightness of the universe, only a minor version.
They're preferably confronted with the dark theory, and it's what you see in this blue pump.
Red is a hot gas, and finally, you can see a lot of galaxies.
What happens here is the accelerator of times in a very, very big machine.
And it's very important, because it means that very, very small effects that's hard to get out in laboratory can connect and connect to something we can see in nature.
Yeah, it's really fun.
Because galaxies can teach us what is dark material, the reason why galaxies can teach us about physics very little, and it's what they're too big.
Second thing: physics is very strange.
The worded age is actually going to run the head.
If there's something more strange, it should be dark energy.
If I put the floor in the air, I expect he to fly the fire.
But I don't expect that he's going to fly a carbon with much more and more speed.
So cosmos also explain why the universe is expanding.
They don't understand why it's amplified with much more speed.
They don't give this result of accelerated expansion of the name, and they call it dark energy.
And then we want to understand more about it.
So a particular question that emerges is how does dark energy influence the world in the most powerful machine?
And depending on its power, the structure can buy its risks faster or faster.
And the problem of the universe in a big way is that it's horrible.
Let's look at the software simulation.
We need something to solve it.
I want to think about it using an analogy.
To understand how Titanic was lost, the most important thing is not the model of the localization of every small car car that was broken.
The most important thing is to see two most parts.
So I can learn a lot about the world in the largest scale, looking for the largest parts of it, and these parts are the fusion of galaxies.
Lastly, I'm going to end my conversation, but you can feel little embarrassed.
I'm thinking about what I started with how vital connectivity of galaxies, and I showed some of these reasons, but how do I actually use them?
And so, for a report, I want to work with Henry Ford when he asked him about cars.
"And what he said, ""If I asked people what they need, they would say they need faster horses."" The dream of our society is confronted with a very large number of problems."
And the solution of these problems is not obvious.
They're not the faster horses.
They need a huge number of scientific innovations.
Well, we need to connect, so we need to focus, but we also need to remember innovation, innovation, inspiration — that's what happens when we expand our field of vision when we're doing a step back when we look out.
And for me, the best way to do this is to learn the world around us. Thank you.
(Applause)
"Well, imagine you're sitting on the street anywhere in America, and here comes to you a Japanese and says, "Do you see what is this block?""
"And you say, ""Look. Well, it's the Owl Street, and it's the Elm Street."
"It's two six, and it's two seven."" He says, ""Well, what's this block called?"" You say, ""You know, there's no name in blocks."
"Laughter has names; blocks are just an unbelievable door between the street."" He goes out, and it's pretty embarrassed and frustrated."
"And now imagine yourself that you're standing on the street, you go in Japan, you're going to someone like you, and you say, "Do you see how is this street called?""
"They say, ""Oh, there's a block 17, and it's a block 16." And you're saying, ""Well, but what's it called this street?"" And they say, ""How do you say, the street has no name."
There are names in blocks.
Here's Google Maps. Here's the block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
All of these blocks are names, and the voice is just an unbelievable process between blocks.
"And you're saying, ""Well, but how do you know your home age?"" Anne says, ""Well, it's just, it's the eight area."
"There's a block 17, a house number one. You're saying, ""Laughter. But walking in the area, I noticed that women are not targeted by the same way."" And Anne says, ""It's not in the same way. Laughter is dependent on when women were built."
The house built in the first block is a house number one.
The house that was built to the second is a house number two.
"The third house is a house number three. It's just simple. It's obvious."" So I think we're always going to go on the other side of the ground to understand something that we didn't even appreciate, and to realize that absolutely impossible things are possible."
Here's, for example, in China, there are doctors who believe that their work is to maintain your health.
So every month when you don't get sick, you'll pay them, and if you don't have to pay them, because they didn't have been able to deal with their job. They're rich when you're healthy, and not when you're sick.
"(Applause) All in any music, ""Rise"" is a momentum, the beginning of a musical phrase. Once, two four."
"One in North African music, ""Now"" is the end of the phrase, the student said."
You can hear it not only in the words, but also in the way they say these songs, two, three, four, once.
And this map is also right.
(Laughter) So saying that in all the truth that we say about India, there's resistance that is also true.
So let's not forget whether TED or it's going to be independent of what's a close idea in you or what you hear, it's also true.
Domo arigato gozaimashita.
