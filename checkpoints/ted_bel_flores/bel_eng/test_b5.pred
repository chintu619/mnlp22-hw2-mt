To the end of this year, there's about a billion people on the planet who are actively using computers.
All of them are sure they're ever dying.
Because it's a terrible thought, but I think it's a serious consequences that you need to see.
I've first thought about this after I was posted in the Drec K. Miller blog, a science-tech journalist who died from cancer.
Miller asked his family and friends to write a written post published after his death.
That's what he wrote in the beginning.
"He said, ""Well, I died, and it's my last post on the blog."
"So I asked my body just to look back from the knee, my family and my friends publish the prepared message I wrote as the first part of my blog from the active book."" It's not true that as a journalist, Miller's archives could be written better and more accurate, and more detailed, the matter that today all of them create archives that are completely different from what was created by any previous generation."
Let's look at the roof of statistics.
Now, 48 hours of video are uploaded on YouTube every week.
There's 200 million tweets per day.
The middle user of Facebook creates 90 units of content per month.
If you think about their parents or grandfather and grandfather, they've actually created a few photos, or home videos, or a day living in a room.
But today, we're creating incredibly rich digital archives that will live in unknowingly how much time after our death.
I think it's creating a incredibly intriguing opportunity for engineers.
To be clear, I'm a journalist, not a technician, so I would like to focus the core of what today and future will be like.
We've already seen some services that allow us to say what happens with our online profils and experiences in the redesign after our death.
One of them, quite yearly, found me in a new York restaurant box on Foursquare.
(Applause) Adam: Welcome.
Death: Adam?
A: Yeah.
Death: Death can kill you anywhere at any time, even in Angola.
A: Who is that?
"Laughter: Go to ifidie.net, [""If I'm dying.net"] until it became too familiar."
(Laughter) And: Right, isn't true?
This service makes a pretty simple thing: you can create a message or a video that can be published on Facebook after your death.
The second service has a name of 1000 memories.
It allows you online to download the right thing and complete it with photos, videos and stories they can publish after your death.
But then, it's just interesting.
Most of you, for example, heard about David Roya who wanted to design how he could test more than 90,000 hours home videos.
I think with the enhancing of the ability to understand the human language and develop big data, it will be able to analyz the content for life — tweets, photos, videos, messages on the blog — what we produce in many ways.
And I think it's just going to happen, for our digital individuals, it's possible to continue to interact with the real world after our death, thanks to expand the content that we created, and it's able to give technology that sense.
Now, we're looking at a couple of experiments.
There's a service — My next Twitter, it's analyzing all your records in Twitter, everything you've sent, and making predictions that you can write the next.
So as you can see, the outcome can be chemical.
Imagine what it's going to look like in 5, 10 or 20 years with the improvement of technical capabilities.
Doing a step forward, MIT laboratory media works on robots that can interact as people.
And if the works were able to interact on the basis of the unique characteristics of a person, hundreds of thousands of the content that a person created for a whole life.
Lastly, look at the famous characters in the night of the US's election in 2008, when the CNN studio broadcasts the voice of William.I.Am'a to an interview with Anderson Cooper.
And what if we could use this technology to control how we've been able to look at our loved ones in the host, and that's really realistic, based on the content they created when they lived?
I think it's absolutely possible, because the volume of data and technical capabilities that we've created for their analysis are increased in geometric pragmatism.
So I think we all have to think if we want it to be real? And if it's meant to find life and what else.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Second exception is from the head of the government.
Unfortunately, the answer to these questions is right.
After that, you can do predictions and test them.
What do we know about complex systems?
It means that the literal system doesn't consist of their parts.
Where are economic networks?
We've been scanners on myoms networks.
The quality of businesses is determined.
"How are they organized?"" They're born alone?"
These are companies that work in more than one country, and there are 43,000.
I'll explain by an analogy.
And more specifically, I want to talk about what's not the way we talk about love.
I don't know you't follow, but if I'm thinking this method, I see a cartoon stage — like this person, he's going to walk, and never imagined, he goes to a open person, and he's going to channel.
And I think it's just so, because it's not going to accelerate.
It's sudden and uncontrollable.
It's something that happens with us without our permission.
I'm a writer and also a teacher of English, which means, talking about words, I'm going to live.
You can say, and I want to emphasize that many methods that we use to talk about love are even having a major part of them have a problem.
So in love, we fall.
We're getting together.
We're growing up.
We're suffering.
We remember from the fire.
Love makes us worthy, and food makes us sick.
Our hearts look at, and then they're broken.
So our methophores improve the obsession of someone to excess violence or disease.
(Laughter) Just like that.
And they position us as a number of unforgettable and unforgettable devices.
"I love them, it's ""smitten" that's the last form of the word ""smite."" And if you look at the meaning of this word in the word — (Laughter) you see that it means it, and it's ""smitten."" And I'm really embarrassed."" As a rule, I'm associated the word ""smite"" with a very special context with Old West."
"So in one Book of Exodus, there are 16 messages to the word ""Applause," which in the Bible is used to be called God's devastated."
(Laughter) We use the same word to talk about love that we interpret our sex. (Laughter)
Right?
How did it happen?
How were we going to join love with great pain and compassion?
And why do we talk about this kind of good experience, how do we offer?
It's hard questions, but I have a few theory.
And to release it, I want to get into a concrete method that reflects love as compassion.
When I started to study romance for the first time, I studied these methods of barbarization everywhere.
In the history of the Western culture, there's a rich language that causes love to psychic disease.
Here's a few examples.
I was the first time I was 20 years old, and it was enough uncomfortable relationships with the beginning.
These were relationships to disturbance in the first few years, so for me, it was very high levels and low levels.
I actually remember one moment.
I was sitting on a hotel room in South America, and I saw my friend come out of the door.
It was known, it was almost entirely, we've been going to dinner, and when we went back to our watch, he left his things in the bag and he left the press.
If I don't remember the causes of this failure, I'm very clearly reminded of how I looked at it.
I was 22, it was my first bathroom in a country that evolved, and I was completely single.
I got a week to my journey home, and I knew the name of the city in which I was, and the name of the city I needed to get to fly, but I didn't have idea how to focus.
I didn't have a short engineer and very little money, and I didn't know Spanish.
Someone more courageous than I could calculate it as a moment of chance, but I stopped.
I just sit there.
And then it grew up.
"But despite my panic, a little voice in my voice thought, ""Oh, it was dramatically."
"I really love me."" (Laughter) Because some of me wanted to feel uncomfortable in love."
Now it sounds so strange for me, but at 22 years, I tried to have dramatic experiments, and at that moment, I was unbelievable, angry and devastated, and it's pretty strange, but I thought that it would never confirm the feelings of a guy who had just left me.
I think, at a kind of scale, I wanted to be a little boring thing, because I thought it was love and work.
"It doesn't really have to be surprising, and it's not surprising to take into account that there are eight films, 14 songs, two albums and one novel called ""The Great Love."" After a half hour, he came back to our eyes."
We've got sure.
But love someone so — like my success was entirely dependent on love, it wasn't really good for me or for him.
But I believe that this type of love isn't very extraordinary.
Most of us feel like a little bit of pollination at the early stage of pollination.
In fact, there's a study that claims that it's normal, because neuroscience shows that stagnation and physical disturbance are not so easy to distinguish.
It's really true.
"This study in 1999 uses blood tests to acknowledge that the rate of saturation of saturation is very similar to the rate of saturation in people with the diagnosis of ""assessively compulsive disturbance.""
(Laughter) Well, and the rate of serotinian is also associated with the syndrome of the season's effective disturbance and depression.
So there's a few evidence that love is really linked to change of our minds and behavior.
And other studies suggest that most relationships start this way.
Researchers claim that a low level of serotinian is connected with the self-conscious thinking about the object of love that reflects the feeling that someone has been sitting in your minds.
And most of us feel like it when they're love for the first time.
I decided that if my friends can't understand my devastating mountain, I don't need their friends.
So I stopped dealing with most of them.
And it was, for example, the most extraordinary year in my life.
But I think I'd feel that being temporary is my job, because if I was temporary, I could tell me how much I would love him.
And if I could tell it, we would finally stay together.
It's also true belief, because there's no universal rule that claims that big wealth leads to great awards, but we talk about love like it's true.
Our experience of love and biological, and cultural.
Our biology says love is good, activating the collection of awards in our brain, and she says that love is like when after stress or growth, neurological awards are eliminated.
In fact, you've heard about it, saying about neuroscience, to survive the isolation like the stagnation from the caffeine that I'm really exhausting.
(Laughter) So our culture uses a language to mold and adapt this idea of love.
In this case, we talk about the symptoms of pain, addiction and dignity.
It's a pretty interesting bumeron of reverse connection.
Love is powerful and sometimes visible, and we show it through our words and history, but then our words and stories prepar us to wait for strong and loving love.
It's surprising that it's all happening in a culture that shaming life.
By being, we're looking for initial and barbaric love, and we want that I'm going to continue life.
It sounds scary.
(Laughter) To imagine that, we need to change our culture or to change our expectations.
Imagine we all would be less passionate in love.
If we were more confident, more open to a new, more green, but instead of love, we would have access to it.
I know that this requires a lot of things, but I'm not the first person who offers it.
"In the book ""The metafore we live"" the logists Mark Johnson and George Leckoff suggest a interesting solution to this film: we need to change our metafore."
They claim, and they can even act as leaders of our future things, like processed products.
John and Leckof offer a new metafora for love: Love as a collective art.
I'm really interested in this way to talk about love.
Lingvisists say, metafore are logically supported that, in essence, there's a way to see all the concepts or ideas that are in the metafore.
John and Leckof say everything that collaboration on art shows: exilations, compromises, perseverance, general goals.
These ideas are good to meet our cultural incorporation into long-term romance relationships, but they also work well in other kinds of relationships — short-term, casual, free, immortality — because these metaphories don't bring more complex ideas to someone's love.
So if love is a joint creative of art, then love is a systemic experience.
Love is unprecedented, love is creative, love requires collaboration and discipline, it's frustrating and economically successful.
And love is composed of assos and pain.
In fact, every love experience is different.
When I was younger, I never thought that I could not accept everything I wanted to love.
When a fourth-year-old Julia first found it, if a fourth-year-old Julia couldn't be without Romeo, with which she had encountered four days ago, she wasn't frustrated or fascinated.
Where is she?
She wants to death.
Yeah?
And as an attack, at this moment of drinking, the third of the five, Romeo doesn't dying.
He's alive, he's healthy, he's just released from the city.
I realize that the 16th century Verona is similar to the modern North America, but when I read this pizza first, it was 14 years old, it had a sense for me.
Consider love as something I'm doing with someone I love, not just what happens with me without my control or consent, it's a inner power.
But it's still hard.
Love at the last time is absolutely inevitable and devastating, and if I feel embarrassed, I need to remember that my job in these relationships is to talk with my partner about what I want to do together.
It's also not easy.
But it's better than the second option in which love is dignity.
It's a version of love that doesn't accept or lose attention.
Instead, she requires trust to his partner and restoring the situation when it becomes hard to sound very simple, but actually a revolutionary radioactive connection.
Because you need to stop thinking about yourself and your purchases or losses in these relationships, and start thinking that you can offer.
"This version of love allows us to tell us things like, ""Oh, we're not very good collaborators, and we don't have it for us.""
"Well, ""These relationships were a battle as I've planned, but it was amazing."" The total art is good to that he doesn't want or don't lose himself."
This version of love allows us to explain how the apple looks like.
Thank you.
(Applause)
One week in the 95th, I was another student with a friend who was driving a car from Provedans, which was in Rood Island, to Portland, which was in Argentina, 5000 miles.
You know how it goes when you're young and unemployed — we didn't walk through the masters, around the north national park, national roads, by course, the longest way.
One week in South Dakota (after 3000 kilometers) I went back to my friend and asked me that I've been going to be around 3000 kilometers.
"What's this about the irroglyf that's all over the road?"
She went out in her eyes to the lab.
Thank you to sit in the first place really exactly now, it's the expression of your body.
(Laughter) So I said, "You know, these signs along the way, which are with the Chinese English."" She's going to stop on me for a couple of minutes, and then she's wearing a smile, because she finally understands.
What I'm.
(Laughter) Here's he, this famous heroic place for pizza. (Laughter)
In the past five years, I've been thinking much about the same situation — why we sometimes understand the signs of roaming, and how we're going to show ourselves when it happens, and what we all understand about the nature of humans.
Secondly, I've spent the past five years in discussions about the state of failure.
My career's choice can be not surprising, but there's a great privilege: lack of competition to work.
(Laughter) But most of us would be able to walk from our thinking about our ignorance, or they would not want to think about their disability.
Absolutely, we understand that.
And we know that sometimes everyone in this room is going to move.
We're people, we're going to be wrong. Well, please.
But if it's about me, at this moment, my translations in this data, suddenly all the abstract views of human need to get ahead, and I'm not able to imagine that I'm sorry.
What's interesting is that we live in this data time.
In them, we go to meetings, and they're going to eat vacations, and they're going to the bees and give our voice.
In practice, we all run through life in the way we believe we always have a reason.
I think it's a problem.
In my view, it's a problem like each of us, on a personal or professional level, and all of us together as society.
What I want to tell today is the first foundation because we're looking at the sense of our right.
Secondly, it's why this approach is problematic.
And finally, I want to convince you that it's possible to get out of the shuttle of this sense, and if you're able to do it, it's the best of all of you look at marathon, wisdom and creativity that you can do.
Why do we feel like our listening?
It's a condition that's associated with the sense of ignorance.
Let's ask you, maybe, because you're here. What's the emotions that happen if you're not right?
Easyness. Incapacity.
Compassion. Good, fantastic, super.
Compassionate, with unconscious sense, with the sense of compassion, thank you, they're all a file answer, but they're answering another question.
You answer the question: "What senses causes understanding that you're not right."
(Laughter) The understanding of all of your thoughts makes you feel like what it was said, and the entire spectrum, right?
For example, there can be a terrible feeling, whether it's a feeling of humiliation of understanding, or even a joyful feeling like with my stupid Chinese genius.
But the condition of ignorance itself doesn't cause any sense.
For example, this is an analogy.
Do you remember the multiverse company Luna Cunch, where this misceral flight is going to run all the time, but does it never deal with the walking band?
But in every episode of this series, the lion seems to walk behind the blind, and it flows from the opposite scale that's not difficult because the blind is a birds, and it can fly.
But every time, the lion flows from the rocks now, it's like a flock.
What's funny, especially if you're only six years old, is that it's too difficult for coffee.
He's simply going to walk until he's looking at the dollar and doesn't understand what he's going to see in the wind.
So then he begins to fall.
If we're thinking about something, not if we understand what we're thinking, but that, we're like this tattoo, after the scale, but down.
You know, we've been afraid, we've already been able to deal with it, but we still feel confident on the ground.
I have to change what I've been saying.
There's a sense of ignorance, it's a sense of your right.
(Laughter) Because of this structural reason, we've ever been connected to the sense of our rights.
I'm blind.
And more, we don't have a mechanism that would suggest if we're wrong until we don't know.
There's another reason why we're interested in this sense, it's more related to culture.
Imagine a little early school.
You're a resident, and the teacher turns out to control, and one of them looks like it.
Now, it's not my.
(Laughter) Here's you in your school, and you know exactly what you think about a classman who has received this note.
He's stupid and bad, he's never doing home jobs.
So at the nine-year-old age, you've learned that, first, those who're thinking, they're going to be let's be let's go back, and secondly, to achieve success in life, you can't never be wrong.
We're learning these bad eyes very much more human.
Most of us, and as I think, especially in this room, are going to take this lesson, they're going to be absolutely wonderful, perfect, compassionate.
Or not, the executive director of finance, the same astrophysis, is he also a super marathon?
(Laughter) So as you're doing, you're all such directors, astrophysics and marathonists.
Let it be.
The situation is worse only when we're invented that we're wrong.
Because thinking in this way, when we do a mistake, we're saying that something isn't like us.
So we insist on our own, because so we feel reasonable, accountable, free and protected.
Let's tell you about the failure.
For a few years ago, the Beth Israel Dickonese hospital took a woman to operate.
This hospital is located in Boston.
In this hospital, students from Harvard are going to practice, and he's one of the best in the country.
This woman was taken and stuck to the operation room.
She's fallen under drugs, the surgeon manipulates it, and he's going to take it, and he's prosecuted in a post-operative room.
In fact, the operation went normal.
"Laughter begins, she looks and says, ""Why's I not connected to that eye?"" And she's connected to that eye because the surgeon did a serious operation on her left foot, not on her right."
When he said about this discovery as a processor, he said something very interesting.
"And after the unknown reason, a prosthetic surgeon felt that he worked on the right way."" (Laughter) Why I'm talking about it, because believing your sense of what you're at the right sight of something can be very dangerous.
It's the inner sense of all listening that we always feel, and it's impossible to believe as the only perception of what actually happens in the backworld.
And if we're in our ways, we're just looking at this way, and we don't think about the intensity of our intelligence, we're doing stupidity about 760 million litres of oil in the West of Mexico, or the neutralization of the global economy.
It's a giant problem for practice.
But it's also a giant problem for society.
Think about a minute that means listening to your rights.
It means that your beliefs listen to disturbance the reality.
With this sense, a strange problem is the explanation for all those people that you're unhappy.
It seemed that most of us would explain ourselves people with other view using the virus of wrong thinking.
The first thing we usually think if someone of us is wrong is that we believe they're not satisfied with these questions.
They don't have access to the information that you have, and if you share this information with them, they'll come to them, and they're going to your camp.
If it doesn't happen when we realize that they have the same facts with us, but they continue to remember, we move to the side of the other opinion — it's what they're ideas.
(Laughter) They have all the tools that they need, and they're not able to gather them.
And if it doesn't work when we understand that people who don't talk to us have the same facts, and they're too reasonable, we're going to third thought, they know the truth, but for their wrongdoing purposes, they transform this truth.
It's a disaster.
And that's our privileges to rejection our rules don't give us to produce mistakes, especially if it's obligatory, and it motivates us to look at each other.
What I'm more likely to stand, I think it's tragic that this situation is absolutely happening with our human essence.
Being, we want to believe that our minds are those unbelievable disruptive stations that we're able to observe and clearly describe the strange world.
And we want all to follow the universe through the same angle, and we see exactly the same.
It's true, and if it was, the world would be incredibly nudious.
Our mind is not what we can see the world he's.
He is that we can see the world not like it.
We can have compassion about the future, thinking about the future, and we can imagine ourselves, being we are other people in other places.
It's just because everyone sees the clothes differently, we can see the same angle of the middle sky and see it, and that, and that.
That's why we're wrong.
"For 1200 years before David wrote his famous word "I think and think there is," he wrote, "fallor ergo sum" — "I'm thinking and knowing there."
Augustin realized that the fact of our compassion is not the invisible failure of the human system, nothing to prevent or eliminate.
It's the foundation of our human beings.
Because we're not God, we don't know what happens in this world.
Unlike other animals, we're really trying to capture this world.
I think that it's a smooth distance, it's a root and a flow of all our productivity and creative imagination.
Let's, in different ways, I started to listen to a lot of publishers of the program "This American Life" on the public radio.
And I heard, I heard, and I started to feel that all the conversations were about something wrong.
"In the first time, I thought, "It happened.
Now, I'm always looking at ignorance.
"It seems to me everywhere."" That's a Greek gift.
But for a few months, I've been able to get an interview in the Irish Voice's curriculum.
I shared this opinion with them, and he said to me, "It's really that."
He showed that the designers of the program even joke that in every version, this is the same topic.
"And she's going to say, "I thought that's what happens, and it's really different."" What's interesting, I said, "Every thing we need that information."
We need these moments of failure and transformation of ignorance to survive these stories."" What's like us all, authors, as listeners or readers, is that stories of satisfaction.
We're looking for the transformation of the story, the creative steps and the undependent consequences.
What happens to our stories, we're going to be afraid.
But you know that our stories are like, because our lives are like it.
We think that's going to be so, and it's really different.
George Bush thought it would attack Iraq, and there would be a mass destructive weapon, liberating people and preserving the Democracy of the Middle East.
And finally, it happened differently.
Also, José Mubarak thought he would be a digater of Egypt to the end of his life until he was confronted and devastated, and then he could transfer his own power to his son.
And finally, it happened differently.
Maybe, you've ever thought you're going to stop and stop with a cool school, get back to your home city, and you're looking for how many kids together.
And finally, it happened differently.
I have to admit that I thought I would write the most simple book about something that doesn't work for readers that would never be.
And finally, it happened differently.
(Laughter) That's the same life.
We're developing amazing ideas about the extraordinary world, sometimes it's the best way, sometimes not. And the world is dominated and fascinated.
Don't worry, but all this conference is like a memory of our compassion.
We've spent a whole week talking about innovation, acceleration and transformation, but you know why we need these innovations, accelerations and transformation?
Because the idea, which was really interesting and had the opportunity to change the world, look at TED in 1998, what is there.
(Laughter) Have you tried, or not that? (Laughter)
Where's my idol, Chris? (Laughter)
(Applause) And we're here again.
And it's going to continue.
We'll find another idea.
We're talking about another story.
We're participating in another conference.
The topic of today, as you've heard seven million times, is how to find beauty again.
So if you really want to find the beauty again, then go through the border of this little bit and fear the space of your right and look at each other, also look at the infinity, the integrity and the mystery of the universe, and let you say, "And I don't know.
"I can be sorry."" Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you all. (Applause)
Five October 1990 a person named El-Saide Nasar went to the hotel in Manhattan and lost Mary Khan, the leader of the League of Hebrew Defense.
For the first time, Nazareth recognized the unknown in the battle, but when he was born for other crimes, he and his colleagues started planning attacks on a series of New York celebrity, including panels, crafts and the United Nations's headquarters.
Well, these plans were done by FBI's infirmator.
But unfortunately, the crash in 1993 in the World Trade Center failed.
As a result, Nazareth was accused of participating in the ability.
El-Saide Nasar is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983 in a family of an egipsian engineer and a grandmother of Americans, teachers of early classes, and their parents were able to make my childhood happy.
But when I was seven years old, the communication in our family began to change.
My father showed me the side of Islam that had little to have to see, including even most Muslims.
My experience shows that when people know each other, they don't have enough time to realize that in fact we all want each other.
But in every religion, every generation, there's a little percent of people who are so fascinated to accept their beliefs that they feel need to use any resources to enable others to live according to their rules.
A few months later, my father sent me, and he told me that a few last weekend, he went with his friends to London Island for a coach.
He said I'll go with them next morning.
We went to Calverton's strike, which the FBI's left.
At that day, my last shot came into a small arrangement lamp around the mix, and, to all-round surprise, and especially my, the whole dimension fell down.
"My daughter came back to friends and he said in Arabic, ""Ibn Abu."" Who's a father, like a son."
They've all really distinguished this future, but only a few years later, I realized it fully.
They looked at me like the same killer that my father was.
In the result, those people were accused of the crash of the truck, which was chargeed by families of cyberbullying in the underground park on the north side of the World Trade Center, and that explosion led to six people, the deaths received more than a thousand.
These were the men that I did.
"These people I called ""am," which means ""God.""
Every time I started to feel comfortable at one place, I've got time to show things and move to another city.
When I was always a new person in the class, I was often a human minority.
I learned to judge people on the basis of cases, like religion or race.
What opened me the eyes?
The first thing that ended with this image of thinking was happening during the President's elections in 2000.
Through the preparatory program, I could participate in the National Congress of People in Philadelphia.
The members of our group introduced the most different plates of society.
One time, close to the end of the journey, I found that one of my new friends was a big friend.
I didn't have any Hebrew friends in the past, and I really said, I was proud of the barrier, in the imperativity I believed almost all my life.
And the second turning point was the summer building in Bush Gardens, and it was a park of attractions.
So I've seen people of the most different beliefs and cultures, and this experience was fundamental in building my personality.
Some of the crudades that were spent in childhood, have led me into the sense of compassion to attract others, and for me, it's not natural to go to other good people as I would like to stand to me.
This feeling allowed me to compare stereotypes that taught me in childhood with life experiences.
And then the Daily Show was, and every night, John Stuart asked me to be honest with myself after my own fascination, and he helped me understand that race, religion or sexual attention didn't have anything common with personal characteristics.
In many ways, he changed me to the father I needed.
The inspiration often comes from where you really don't expect it, now I'm well aware that the cloud impacted on my world's look more positive than my father-expression.
One time, I talked with my mother about how I started to change my vision, and she told me something that I'll keep my whole life in my heart.
At that moment, I realized how much negative energy is needed to maintain this uncertainty inside me.
Because Abraham, it's not my true name.
I took him when my family decided to break the relationships with my parents and start a new life.
Why do I open my person and potentially threaten me?
Well, it's just simple.
Instead, I use my experience in fighting terrorism, in fighting fanatism.
I'm doing this for victims of terrorism and their parents, for terrible pain and losses that caused their part from terrorism.
In memory of the victim of the terrorism, I'm talking to these misconditional actions, and I ask my father's actions.
I'm here as a proof that violence is not a permanent part of religion or race, and that the son is not obligated to support his father's path.
I'm not my father.
Thank you. (Applause) Thank you all. (Applause) Thank you all. (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause)
But it can't be so.
I'm the one who love chocolate bees.
I've learned all this through these 30-day tests.
That's the idea of my experiment when I've done a picture every day in a month.
I've never seen the beauty.
She's horrible.
They're actually the biggest.
(Applause)
I've really excited to be born in a country that is the best place in the world to be woman.
In 1975, when I was seven years old, women in Iceland went to a vacant.
At that day, they didn't work, independent of whether they had a job or just a home job.
They went to Reckivic center, and 90 percent of women were involved, and they asked for equality and solidarity.
Nothing worked in Iceland on that day, because nothing works when women don't have.
(Applause) For five years, islanders had the ability to become the first country in the world that democratically selected a woman as president.
I'll never forget that day when the President Higgs, known in our behalf, went on the balkon of his home, my mother alone with my daughter, after his victory.
(Applause) She became an amazing model to change for me and everyone who grew up at that time, including kids.
She often told her a story about a guy who came to her after a few minutes on his post, and he said, "And the kids can also be leaders when they grow?" (Laughter) The roll models are really important, but even with the strong perspective to transform that I'm very confident when I've been invited to talk to the president's post, my first response was, "Who's I going to get to this post?"
"Who's I like to be president?"" It's true that women are less likely to try to be a leader than men."
A study conducted in the U.S. in 2011, showed that 62 percent of the men looked at their appointment at president, but only 45 percent of women.
We see a breakdown in 16 percent, and it's the same breakdown that happened decades ago.
It's true horror, because I'm confident that this world needs women of leadership and more accurate leadership over all.
So my decision to fight finally came to what I felt needed to make my contribution, even without any political experiment, to go ahead and to try to take part in creating a world that will have a sense to drive three for our kids, where we really allow us to and children, and girls to achieve everything they want.
It was the journey of my entire life.
It was amazing.
The journey started with 20 patients.
After the qualification, the number was connected to nine candidates, and finally the race came to us four, three men and me.
(Applause) But it's not a drama.
Maybe you think there are drama in the United States, but I can — (Laughter) I can say that we're not worse in Iceland.
In the first century, the president who was the last 20 years, felt that it wasn't going to be fighting, it's going to be, and it led to that number of candidates.
And then he thought when our Prime Minister was able to report because the suspicious famous Panama documents that he and his family were involved.
In Iceland, a popular protest took place, because the president felt that the country needed a recognized leader.
And a few days later, the relationship with his wife and her family was also left in Panama documents, and he went back from the race.
Before he was sitting, he realized that he did that, because there's two qualified men who can be his annual translators on his position.
So, 9 weeks, 45 days later, the question seemed not very good for me.
I didn't even pick a place in the journal chart.
According to a survey, I had one percent, but all the same, it was the highest position among women in the audience.
It's going to change to say that I've given the example of all the suggestions to get my place back and get to TV, because the TV decided to include only customers with a minimum of 2,5 percent of the voice in the first TV.
At the day of these debate, I've learned that I'll take it together with three men, and I learned that I was 2.5 percent in the day of the first debate.
(Applause) And about problems.
The fundamental problems that were forced to meet and do on this path were connected with media, support and play.
Let's start with media.
Some claim that sex has no meaning for media and politics.
I can't agree.
I've been trying to get more accessible and more efficient time in the media.
In fact, the leading candidate came out in the public media 87 times a few months before the election, and I came there 31 times.
And I don't say media to do that.
I think there's a source in a unknown page, because in the media, more than everywhere, there's a known and unknown page, and we need to have the ability to speak about it if we want to reduce.
"When I finally got access to TV, the first question came so, ""Do you want to remove your application?"" It was a hard question.
Now, with a result of one to 2,5 percent of the voices in the audience, you can understand it.
But media actually have a meaning, and every time I've been on TV, we've seen and experienced an increase in interviews, so I don't know how important it's, and why we need to talk about it.
I've never had one of the four final candidates in the first place.
I've always been left by questions that were raised by all the rest of the candidates, and by the light of the choices.
I've been confronted with it, but I'll tell it a computer of Islamic Media.
There wasn't almost any commentary in the case of my voices or my cosmos.
(Applause) Let them be written.
But there's another very important experience.
I was like a independent candidate, without any political party or support.
This lack of experience and access to resources, perhaps, has gone through our company, but also allowed to introduce new and do politics differently.
Our company was positive, and so we might have changed the tone of choices for others.
I'm in this source of less time on TV because I wanted to show attention to another printer.
When access to media was extremely complex, we started our own information resources.
I've conducted online interviews on Facebook, and I've been able to answer any questions of voters.
All the questions that we received together with the answers, we were released to open access to Facebook, because we believed the importance of access when you wanted to install a trust.
When I found a problem to take attention to young volunteers, I started using Snapchat.
Prayer showed me how to do this, and I used every filter in Snapchat during the last part of the company.
I've really suffered a lot of humors and room, because I'm a prophet here.
But thanks to this, we have increased the number of favorers among the population.
It's true that it's possible to know the company and in a different way.
Unfortunately, we can't talk about politics and not remember money.
It's true, but it's true, and we had less financial resources than in other customers.
Maybe, the source was partly that, in my view, the time was unbelievable to ask for financial support.
And maybe I tried to do more with less costs.
Some say that it's very sexy.
But even with the lost media and financial resources, and only with a entrepreneur, but a wonderful company, we were able to appreciate all the day of the choices when the first numbers came.
I've fascinated myself as you can see on the picture.
(Laughter) Based on the first data, I went together with a leading customer.
(Applause voice) Well, too early, because I couldn't win, but I took a second place, and we went a long way from one point to almost a third part of the voice, and we decided that we were looking for an unprecedented breakdown, and the result was 10 percent higher than the last investigation.
Because some of them put me a real winner of the choices, and many people forced me to beat again.
But in fact, I've been forced to reinforce the knowledge that I've earned a more proportionally higher subsidy from the community, and a large number of people have trained my daughter to speak in 2040.
(Applause) Now she was 13, and she had never been on TV.
But on the day of the choices, I've always seen her on TV, she was smart, confident, she was honest and supported her mother.
Maybe it was the most important moment of my company.
(Applause) But there was another.
At the time, the girls of the age of depression saw my poster at an autopsic stop, and they wanted to beat it.
Autory: Oh!
It's just a victory for me.
We can achieve everything we see.
There's a sort of fear and problems.
(Applause) Women's leadership needs, and it's time to kill women, if it's the post of a gender or a president.
"And I've also managed to imagine your family magazine ""New Yorker."" I've found a new title, "The real sense of honestness."" (Applause clicks) Maybe it's my most popular title, because women are too often struggling for the profit of emotional capital as I call him, but I know with their own hope that we're going to win only when we do that."
(Applause) And we need to use it more.
On the day of the choices, we celebrate, we've been overwhelmed, because we feel like it.
It's absolutely impossible to get this path.
You just need to go to this, and you, your family and friends, everyone who's going to work with you if you're doing good, you're going to grow higher than what you've lived in the past.
We've done good time, and I'm rich because I learned during this journey, more than I can tell you today.
But be sure, it was a hard job.
I've got a little sleep in those months.
And the compassion and compassion came out to not sit, and I finally realized what I knew on the day of a single point: you can only listen to yourself and act in harm with this inner voice.
So as my good sister says, you can bed your intuition, but intuition never bed you.
I also want to emphasize, and you all know that, in every journey, the key thing is your team.
People thought that they share your values and vision, but they're different.
For me, it's the form of success, and I'm happy with a wonderful man who today is here, a wonderful family, (Applause) and a wonderful friend, we've come up as entrepreneurs in political arena, and we've done something, in people's words, impossible.
In fact, the chief public-related specialist said how I decided that would be good if I get 7 percent.
I looked at his point of view, because he had a reason, and he found his opinion on a valuable challenge.
But on a day, I decided to show that he was wrong.
It's really important to know it, because I'm really very little sleep and actually working like people like me.
We're never able to achieve a lot when we're going to forget the question about ourselves.
I think there are two very important points in this matter: attack themselves with people and things that saturate you, but not less important if not more, have the ability to look at people and actions that pick your energy, including wonderful bloggers and commentators.
And I was fully supported by others, and I decided not to focus attention to the abrases, and it was partly because my energy was lost all that time.
When I lost an energy at a moment — and it happened time from time, because it was not easy — I was talking about my causes to beat, and not just like, but by my rules.
I called our 4G campaign, where G letter means Islamic words.
The first of them is Gagn. I wanted to do a weapon, to be critical, and I wanted the leadership concept as a service to be the center of our work during the transformation.
The second word is "Laud," or joy.
I decided to do this journey.
He could take a lot, regardless of whether it was reached a point of recognition.
And I've done all the suggestions to inspire others.
The third word is Gagnese. I was open for all questions.
I didn't have any evidence, I could learn everything on Facebook or on our websites.
I think when you choose a president, you deserve answers to your questions.
A little less important word of a teacher who doesn't need to explain in this room, we're a big company in the principle Girlpower, the female power.
(Applause clicks) I'm incredibly happy that I found the ability to fight fighting, but it's a lot of success.
I can't say that it was simple, but I'm confident, and I think all of my team would agree, I was worth it.
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
Peter Mitchell: I'm not going to leave you. Hall Thomaser: What good listeners. PM: I can't leave you without telling you.
That maybe everyone in this room is willing to go to Iceland and vote for you.
We're sure if we'll have the right to voice there, but there's something we can take in Iceland, like before, it's an inspiration.
I think it's pretty old to remember 1975 when women in Iceland went out to the street, and it's really a big factor to launch women's movement.
You've been sent to this event earlier. Let's read the picture to imagine how a country looked like it.
And you can't know, because the American media didn't report about it, but the island women went back to the street, right?
HC: Yeah. PM: Can you tell us about it?
HC: 41 years after that vacation, we can be considered the best place in the world to be woman, but our work wasn't finished.
So in a statement, 14,38, women in Iceland left work, because just then they earned their daily income.
(Applause) It was really powerful that young girls and boys were participating in a lot more than before, because it was time to solve the loss.
PM: I'm not going to ask Hall now about its future plans, but I'm going to say that you'll have a big good arm when you're going to do it again.
Thank you, Hall.
HC: Thank you all.
(Applause)
In fact, I tried to think about my career from the time I left the White House, and the best example I had — the New Yorker's utility for a couple of years ago.
"The little boy looking at his father says, ""When I grow up, I want to be an ex-precedent."" (Laughter) I'm very happy as a president, because I had access that little people in the world had ever to meet people around the world."
They press these rules to believe that women are usually able to take social positions in comparison with men in the eyes of God.
So they've published a statement that, in fact, moves women to be holy, clergy, clergy, clergy in the church, or clergy in the arm, when a woman learns in a class in South Boston seminary, she can't teach when a boy in a room because you can find the top in the Bible, and in the Bible more than 30,000 pages, where it's said that women don't have to learn a man, and so later.
But the key thing is that books are wrong interpreted to keep men in a higher position.
Why should I pay them the same reward for the end of the same job?
In the U.S., for example, we had a massive increase in the abrasion of poor, in the core dark people and minorities that were planted in the turms.
Now, 7,3 people from 1,000 are in prison.
It's a symmetrical growth.
Since I left the White House, there was 800 percent of dark women in the turms.
We're one of the few countries in the Earth that today have a moderate generation, which is a developed country.
We're now in California, and I've learned a few days that California has spent four billion dollars to judge 13 people to a mortal death.
One of them is the abrogation of the clerical organs.
Sometimes, in more extreme cases, it's getting out of the hospital so that a girl can be able to get.
And then, when she gets married, it's the same way to start the abortion so that you can't have sex.
It's not the truth, it's also against the law.
In Egypt, for example, 91 percent of all women living in Egypt today were sexually eliminated in this way.
In some countries, it's more than 98 percent of women who are obsessed to be successful.
It's a terrible fat for all women who live in those countries.
And another very serious thing is where a family with wrong explanation doesn't have anything in Korea that's mysterious — kill a girl from his family when she was violent or when she was married or sometimes even when she's wearing it.
It's going to be a family member, so the family becomes a killer when a girl causes a so called shame in the family.
It showed that 75 percent of these deaths were conducted to parents, children or brothers, 25 percent of the deaths were conducted by women.
And the other problem that exists in the world in dealing with women is slavery or humiliation as it's now called.
About 12.5 million people were sold to the New World in the 19th and 18th century.
30 million people live today in slavery.
The U.S. State Department has to pay a debt every year, and the U.S. Department says, through international limits every year, 80 percent of those reported — women who are sexually slavery.
In the United States, just at that moment, 60,000 people live under gins or slavery.
Atlanta, Georgia, where I'm Central Carter, and where I'm studying at the EMAR University, between 200 and 300 women, people.
It's the number one place in the country because of it.
There's also a lot of passengers in Atlanta.
If a boss wants to buy a girl who has the benefits they can do that for 1,000 dollars.
A white girl who's going to get a middle-powered bagel in Atlanta can pay about $ 35,000 by rob.
The sex island in Atlanta, Georgia.
This leads to one of the worst problems, women buy and sold in all countries of the world.
Sweden has a good approach to this.
For 15 to 20 years ago, Sweden decided to change the law, and women are no longer examined by the law when they're in sexual slavery, but the owners of bordels, the supervisor and — (Applause) — the Constitution went to decline.
In the United States,
One man who had 25 women arrested in the United States.
Canada, Ireland, I've already said, Sweden, France and other countries are going to this.
It's another thing that can be done.
We have two big institutions in the country, our army and a great university system.
In the military, it's analyzed.
The last report I received said that happened in the military was 26,000.
Only 3000, a number of more than one percent, and the reason is that a team of any organization is a car, like my ship ship, or a crew in the Marry Five, a team has the right to solve a crime deal, and, of course, the last thing they want to do that under their mandations, they don't do that.
This law should be changed.
The Justice Department says that the campus's campus is done because it's through the university system when they violate someone, but when they're located at the campus.
They're not investigated.
It's what happens in our society.
When I was president, the difference was 39 percent.
So we've got some progress, and so later — (Applause) (Laughter) — but in the past 15 years, there was only about 23 or 24 percent of the difference in the past 15 years.
That's what happens today.
If you take 500 companies, in 23 of them, of 500 women, and those leaders, I'll tell you, they're going to earn in the middle less than the rest of the leaders.
That's what happens in our country.
There's another problem with the United States: we're the most powerful country on Earth.
We've been going to become a war exactly since the Second World War.
And some of our soldiers were at the place of seeing.
And together, we've been running over the voice, putting bomb on people.
And sometimes, though, we're going to have cyberbullying.
We were going to become a war with 25 different countries or more after the Second World War.
Over four years, I'm not going to say what we didn't kill — (Applause) — we didn't kill any bomb, we didn't kill.
But in any case, those things, turned to violence and wrong interpretation of holy books, are the fundamental causes of violence over women.
And there's another fundamentally reason to alarm men.
(Applause) It's true.
A normal man who can say, it's very similar to that when I was young, when compassion and diversity were unified.
But over that time, there was a lot of white people who didn't think that discrimination was appropriate, but they thought they were using the privileges of unique access to the right schools and all other schools, and it's the same thing that there's today, because the general man, in fact, is the same thing that there's today.
"And when they say, ""I'm against disclosure, they're using a privilege."
What's the fundamental thing we need to do today?
I would say, the best thing we can do for women from powerful countries like this, and from where you're born, Europe and then who have the impact to take responsibility to be more translated to end the racism discrimination in the world.
But I hope that after this conference, women translate their men about violence in college campus and military and government, and in the future on the job market, we need to protect their kids and expectations.
I have 12 kids, four kids and 10 truth, I think of them, and I think about them, and I'm not just going to live in Egypt to have equal rights, and I hope you all get to me to be champions for women in the world, and protect their rights to human beings.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s, the future of the world seemed dead.
The growth of the population was not to stop.
The world's voice was safe.
Cancer empathy caused by chemicals in the other environment was trying to cut our lives.
The cold rain fell over the forest.
The oil ended, and the nuclear system of the channel would end up.
With me, my average life was 30 percent higher.
The 10-year humiliation changed to two thirds.
Producing food for the population grew up for a third.
The number of crops on the chart decreases the population's death, and this chart shows GDP on the population.
And with other words, you need to understand how ideas come to sex.
I want you to imagine how we went from creating these concepts to create these.
Lastly, there were some changes, but the idea changed more than the schelet at that time.
It's a successful phenomenon, but it's true.
Now, it's happening in five years.
And more than that, together with different ideas, plastic ideas, laser ideas, transitor ideas.
They were connected to this technology.
And it's a computer, it's a collective technology that intrigues me, because I think it's the key to understand what happens in the world.
My body is also the collection of ideas: the idea of green cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of the skin cells.
They were gathered together.
How does evolution do something mutually or unified?
It's using a slow conversation.
One means another to survive.
In fact, with a room conversation, it's possible to get the person into the legacy of mutation in different lines.
Well, sex allows people to solve genetic innovations of all sorts of visions.
It's not confined to personal nature.
What process has the same effect in cultural revolution that sex has in biological evolution?
I think the answer is a change, the usual change one thing to another.
It's the unique human risk.
No animal doesn't do that.
It can be this oxygen culture.
In printing, there's a culture.
They learn one of the traditions that are translated from parents to our kids.
Shampens games have different cultures in different games.
There's no change of ideas between them.
Why did the change increase life standards?
The statement came from David Ricardo in 1817.
I'm writing his opinion in the version of the Stone Age, which he also explained in terms of trade between countries.
A man produces a wild in four hours and a siker in three hours.
The oz produce a wild in one hour and a syringe in two hours.
It's better than Adam in a product and a siker, and wonders.
And I'm uncontrollable Adam.
He can do his own wonders and sicks.
Adam and Oz were self-expeded by their time.
If you start first, you need to go to the village.
How much is this dream? Have you spent a lot of time.
How much is you going to work for a hour of nightlight to read if you have a average income in UK?
It was done for me by other people.
How exact person did it?
Thirty? Thirty? Thirty?
You know, I think, millions.
And so society works.
That's what we've achieved as biological.
In early hours, when you were rich, people literally worked on you.
498 people every day got a vacant.
In fact, there are other animals that work each other.
Mursi is a classic example.
Carlaella is responsible for growth.
(Applause) When were these behavior started?
But I don't have any evidence of that.
And the beauty of this system is that it's useful for both eyes.
And a man knows that he doesn't need to stop to make a race.
They were a high cooperative knowledge.
They were very reasonable knowledge.
But there's no evidence that they had a branch share of work.
There's no evidence of collection among women.
It seems that women ran together with men.
There's also no evidence of change between groups, because it's one of the foundations of neurothers of projects, the tools they've done are always made from local materials.
For example, in Costa Rica, there's a place where local non-andertal devices were invented.
They are always made from local crisis.
If a person started to change the topics in this way, it's evidence that they changed between groups.
Mandela is 10 times older than farming.
And the early evidence of this is found for some 80-120,000 years ago in Africa, where we see that obsession, shaming and other things are going to get great distances from Ethiopia.
The cancer, as it was invented here, also in Oxford, went 200 miles of mycorrhic pollination from the Mediterranean Algeria.
And it's evidence that people's groups started to change.
And that led to specialization.
What happens if you can limit people from change, from the ability to change and specialise?
The evidence is that it's not just to stop technical progress, but it can even turn it into the opposite way.
A example of this is Tunisia.
The teams were isolated.
Let's come back to discover and ask ourselves, not only who did that and for whom, but who knew how to do it?
Nobody, literally nobody.
"I'm actually named the famous eses of Leonardo Rido, an economist in the 1950s called ""I, Solock," in which he wrote how it's produced, and that nobody knows how to make an analogy, because people in the collection don't know how to get a graph, and they don't know how to plant you and all of that piece."
What we did in the modern society, the way to change and specialization, we created the ability to do things we don't even understand.
It's not the same thing that it's in the language.
Now, so I'm not interested in the debate about the growth of intelligence or have some groups more high IQ than other groups.
It's absolutely not meaningful.
In society, it's important how good people transmit their ideas, and how good they cooperate, not how smart one person is.
We created a collective brain.
We're just the nodes in the network.
We're the neurons of this brain.
In fact, idea, meeting and combining ideas, one of the leading technical progress, step by step.
And there's no matter what hard things happen.
In the future, as we're going to move forward, there's terrible things.
It's war, depression, natural catolicisms.
Strange things happen in this century, I'm absolutely confident.
Thank you.
(Applause)
