I was 11 years old. I remember at one morning, like the indic that I heard the sounds of pleasure in our house.
My father heard the news of the BBC at a little crash radio.
There was a mutilation that we didn't have been habituated at that time, because the news, rather than it.
""My father said, ""It was taken back to Taliban!""
I didn't understand what it meant, but I could see how happy my father was.
""Now you can go to the real school,"" he said my father."
It was a morning I never forgot.
Right to go to school.
I was only six years old when the Taliban bought a school for girls who left Afghanistan.
So, in the next five years, I had to be like a boy to go to the secret school, trying to ask my sister to get out of myself.
That's the only way we can't get both education.
We've gone on a different way every day that nobody has been concerned about where we're going.
We've cut our books into the market bags, because it's just because we're going to shop.
The school was inside a house, more than 100 people were embedded in a little room.
It was comfortable in winter, but it would be terrible in the summer.
Teachers, students and parents — we all could threaten our lives.
Sometimes, because the Taliban suspected, school was closed for a week of a strange time.
We always were afraid of what we know about.
Are they watching us?
Do they know where we live?
We were afraid, but yet, school was where we wanted to be.
I was really lucky because I grew up in a family that valued education and considers girls as a girl.
My father was a great person for his own era.
One of the different ideas that Afghanistan lived in a narrow place, called the girl, the mother, wanted to go to school, so even by his father, was rejected of childhood.
But my teacher mother became a teacher.
It's cool.
Two years ago, he left the village, and he turned our house into a school for girls and women in the neighborhood.
And my father — that's the first person I learned in my family.
And there was no doubt that her children could get education, but the Taliban had risk, despite the danger, looking at risks.
So it was more dangerous to teach kids.
In the years of the Taliban, it came up, it was time, I used to be in the fear of our life, and not to see a light from the future.
"My father would say, ""Hey, my daughter, you can lose everything in your life."
You can have money and money. You can have to leave your house in wars.
But the only thing that's going to stay with you is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school costs, we'll sell you to school.
"Are you tired of continuing?"" I'm 22 years old today."
I grew up in a country that was devastated in a war that continued for decades.
My parents could only finish a middle school less than six percent, and if my family didn't go so much after my education, I wouldn't do it.
Instead, I'm standing here as a blend of the Middlebury Collider that's going around you.
(Applause) When we returned to Arizona, one of those who first congratulated me was my father who sent her daughter to school.
He died not only because I was a prison, but also because I was the first woman that went to her with a car in the streets of Kabil.
(Applause) My family believes me.
I have big dreams, and my family's dreams are bigger for me.
So I'm a leader of a global campaign for women called 10x10 education.
So I'm from the founder of Sola, the first sleep school in Afghanistan, in a country where women are still risked to go to school.
And the most amazing thing is that I see students who are able to use opportunities in my school.
And I see how their parents, their father, my father, are doing to me, despite all those who are confronted, they are helping their daughters.
I can't tell you his face and his true name, but he's one of my students' father.
Approximately a month ago, when she went from Sola to the village, she had just cut them a few minutes from a bomb exploding outside the road.
When he came home, he sat his phones, and the voice on the phone stopped sending her to school until she kept sending her girl to school, so the explosion would be repetitive.
"And he said, ""If you want, kill me now,"" he said, ""But I'm not going to protect my daughter's future for your regression and your old ideas."" The fact that I've recently discovered about Afghanistan, sometimes the fact that the Western people expect — that everyone behind us is knowing the value of a girl who is worthy of success and his father who is worthy of success."
It doesn't mean that our mother's success doesn't open.
In fact, parents are rather analogy that believe and guide girls' light, but in a community like Afghanistan, men's groups are devastating.
In the Taliban, the number of girls who went to school was measured by hundreds — as you know, it was said to Georgia.
Now, more than three million girls who go to school in Afghanistan are now.
(Applause) Afghanistan looks very different when you look from America.
I understand America's uncertainty about changes.
I'm afraid that these changes will not take too long after the U.S. army was taken.
But when I went back to Afghanistan and saw children and their support and their spiritual validity at school, I grew up my commitment to a bright future and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and unlimited opportunities, and girls who read in Sola go back to me every day.
They make great dreams like me.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
It's in every wave that's completely fascinating.
Apocalypse is losing.
It doesn't fly. We're going to go back.
One. Two. Three.
When I saw the first civil death.
It was a doubt about anything.
In fact, as I knew, I was very lucky, many North Koreans didn't have been so lucky.
He taught a new language, and after he got a job, all his lives could be sub-created.
We were all Korean, but after that, we didn't split, we didn't split 67 years.
Am I a South Korean or a North Korean?
So I started planning how to save them.
One of the things I never know.
That's the symbol of my life at that time.
This is a child connection that we've designed in 2007.
We built it in the shape of the surface.
It can hit a period without standing on the ceiling of the building.
If you're a child, you probably know kids like spring very much.
That's how the roof of the building looks like.
Why did we grow like this?
"And another director said to me, ""I don't want to be a sir.""
"And I said to him, ""Well, it's impossible."" But he said, ""What do you do if you look at the outside of the house?"
"You're going to fall on kids."" (Laughter) I said to him, ""Not there."" Of course, the government workers said, ""Sure must be absolute.""
We applied that theory just around trees.
There are three trees inside the building.
And they allowed us to call these corners an orchid.
But it's used completely for another purpose.
They're collapsed on the door.
Children are also collapsed when they're hungry.
(Laughter) Sometimes, around a tree, we collect 40 children.
This boy tree that you see in the Buddhas likes so much that it's eating.
(Laughter) When any event happens, they sit outside the ceiling.
It looks very beautiful down here.
The Lap zoo looks like apples.
(Laughter) It's time to eat.
(Laughter) (Applause) We've put the ceiling as possible, because we want to see children not only under the ceiling, but on top.
If the roof gets too high, it's only possible to see the ceiling.
This is the place to eat a foot — all kinds of water crane.
And what you see is that the giraffes are playing for kids to swim their friends, and they can screw, and that's normal.
But the boy you see is trying to take them with a crane, filling them with water.
(Laughter) It's completely open for many years.
There's no rain from the water and the desert.
And that means that arxectry is basically made of a tree.
There's no surface between the moons.
There are no acoustic obstacles.
Most of the kids start to begin to begin to begin to begin to become sick.
But there's no reason to hide in this connection.
Because there's no floor here.
The police officer says that if the boy who's standing on the corner doesn't want to be in the room, he can go.
It's going to go back, and it's going to go back.
(Laughter) So, what I mean, kids usually like to hide.
And here they go and turn back.
And that's a natural process.
Secondly, we consider that sound is very important.
You know kids sleep better at the voice.
They don't sleep at the heart.
In our connection, children show high concentration in class.
You know that our audience also grow in a soundhole.
They need a voice.
You also know you can easily talk to your friends and voice on the ground.
You don't have to be silent.
You know we're trying to control everything at the time.
And it's completely open.
I'm sure we can go to the wind at 20 degrees in the winter.
And we're going to swim in the summer.
We're solar in a pencil of 50 degrees.
We don't pass water.
We're cooking in the rain.
So we've been created to be in the sky.
And that's what we should do with kids.
They're trying to share the sinifi here.
They have to help their teachers.
But they don't do.
(Laughter) So this guy gets inside and here.
This is the sofa room.
And that's a hand-output.
They talk well here.
Most rooms have trees.
It's trying to keep the tree on the bottom of the tree.
(Laughter) There's more money. (Laughter)
In every classroom, there's no window.
Santa Claus comes from here in the millisphere.
And it's a extra string, built along the right side of the wall.
It has a height of five meters, and it's seven floor.
The sofa is too expensive.
We have to think about security.
We allow a girl to study a boy.
They try to get inside.
The piece is expensive.
It's good, but it's strong.
He is my son. He is my son.
(Laughter) Here he looks like how safe it is to get out of the tree.
And then we left the other kids inside.
You know that it's very hot in Tokyo.
(Laughter) It's trying to learn how the driver is going to drive in the bag.
Now, kids need a little threat.
In such situations, they learn to help each other.
It's a community, and we're giving these opportunities.
This patch shows the motion of a boy from 9.10 to 9.30 at 9.10.
The period of the box is 183 meters.
It's not too small.
Well, this little morning, he walked six thousand meters across.
But the interesting thing is still ahead.
In this connection, children move 4,000 meters per day.
Children here have the highest atletic indicators between the connectors.
"The other officer always says, ""I don't train them. They're just like a bird speed."
"We're going to go on."" (Laughter) They're running for themselves. (Laughter)"
I think we don't have to control them and protect them anymore, but they have to fall out of all.
They have to take little attention.
Because we're going to teach them how to live in life.
I think heritage is capable of changing the world and the lives of people.
This building is one of the steps taken to change children's lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In the 1970s, I worked with gymnastics for two years in Ghana in China.
When I read at first class, I gave me a suggestion that all the costs would be paid by the government for not to go to the atletic school.
"But my old mother said, ""No."" My parents wanted me to be engineers like them."
And what happened after the democratic revolution was that good and safe work is the only way to be happy.
I don't like and don't like my job so important.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera artist.
So this is how I draw my dream pianine.
To be an Opera artist, I needed to work with akrobatics when I was young, and I made my hand to go to the Opera School.
I also wrote a letter to our high school teacher to make a radio show.
But the adults didn't like my mind.
Nobody believed I was serious.
But my friends helped me, they also were young children like me.
So when I was 15 years old, I realized that it was late to train.
My dream was never real.
By the end of my life, I was afraid that my second class would be the only chance to get happiness.
But it was unfair.
I decided to find another way.
No one will show me the way? No.
I invited books.
"To replace the advice of Valide, I asked this book written by a musician family, which was written by the Fou Law family."" And if I asked a legal woman who asked the Constitution tradition, I took the free woman model from this book, ["" Jean Eyr."" And I learned that I was able to be able to read this book, ""The world's cheaper."" The real name: ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" This book inspired me to read outside."
"[""What's the first book I read when I came to the U.S. in 1995, when I came to the United States?"
Of course, books that are prohibited in China.
""The Great Torpaq"" is about Chinese village life."
It doesn't have any advantage in the box. I'm going to look like.
The Bible is interesting, and it's a bit bizarre.
(Laughter) It's the theme of another day.
"But the fiveth century brought me light. I mean, ""You'll honor your father and your mother.""
"And I thought, ""Thank you."" So, I've got the chance to redefine my relationship with my parents from the guilty part of the confuse."
And it gave me the opportunity to compare what I read with new culture.
This can teach you a lot of things.
For example, this map looked strange at me at the first head, because we grow up in China by learning this map.
I never thought China wasn't supposed to be in the center of the world.
In fact, the map shows a look at the world.
It's not new with a wonderful object.
This is a standard practice in the science world.
Even there are fields of science, like religion and comparative literature.
Art and reconciliation helps scientists understand the whole issue.
And I thought, if you're working for research, why don't you make it in your everyday life?
So I started reading books in terms of curves.
"And let's say that people who participated in the same event are about ""Benjamin Franklin"" writer: Walter Isaacson, ""John Adams,"" or friends who are part of the same heritage."
"[""The Story Story"" writer: Katharine Graham] [Laughter: Warren Buffet and Life"" writer: Alice Schroeder) I also like to read a story compared to a couple of months — (Laughter) [The Holy Bible: The King James version] [Laughter"" Christopher Moore: Or Joseph Moore describes the same stories in different cultures as Joseph Campbell had done in his beautiful era."" Joseph Campbell wrote, for example, Jesus and Buddhas, every three cassettes run."
For Jesus' prophet, they were economic, political and spiritual.
Now it's interesting that these were all psychological: courage, fear and social poverty.
If you know foreign language, it's interesting to read books in two languages.
"[""Chuang Tzu Way"" writer: Thomas Merton][""Tao: Waterhole"" (Laughter) And I found other interesting facts in my desk, not just the loss of my mind."
"So, with the help of translation, I realized that happiness in Chinese means ""surfing.""
"The word coming in Chinese is defined as ""my mother." Yes!"
(Laughter) Books play a magic portal that I can connect with people in the past and the Indian time.
I'm never going to be alone or weak again.
It's nothing compared to the difficulty of others.
I started to believe that it wasn't the only goal of the desire to happen.
The main purpose of the desire is to help us connect to the point of hopes, of happiness and happiness.
And the unreal dream is capable of doing that.
Because books are because I'm here today and I'm happy, and I live very often with a clear goal.
"And I say to you, ""The books are always with you!""
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
You didn't stop it. What would you do?
"The person would follow until his room, and you would ask, ""Why am my desk?"" Well, it's Friday night tomorrow, and you're in office, and one of you looks like a meeting meeting on your calendar."
And I speak about something much more valuable than the office furniture.
From time, from your time.
(Laughter) You don't think it's to accept the main sign of the Interconnection Syndrome as you see a meeting invitation in the calendar. (Laughter sounds)
"It's a fantastic reflex — bip, click, dict — in your calendar, ""I'm going to go, I'm late to the meeting."" (Laughter) Sounds are important, isn't it?"
Friendship is the open source of success in every company.
And a meeting going on the road can actually lead to a positive result.
(Laughter) That's why that's not the reason that the person doesn't have a good meeting, but that's the DRS, the Syndrome of Relationship without thinking, that makes us create.
I really believe DRS is a global epidemic.
I'm going to talk to you.
A few years ago, I put a video on YouTube, and I felt that you could have any bad confrontation on this video.
This video for about five minutes unifies everything we hate about bad meetings.
This is a meeting surveillance officer who doesn't want to control the movement.
Participants who don't know why they're.
And he left everyone in a sense of funness.
It's a condition to smile.
(Laughter) Let's look at it very quickly.
(Video) Now, our goal is to understand a very important issue.
Hello, Joe is. I work home today.
(Laughter) Hello Joe. Thank you for being arrested.
As a group — ding dong — (Laughter) Hello, who joined?
(Laughter) Do you know?
Yes, they meet me too.
A few weeks after YouTube, 500,000 people from thousands of countries, really from hundreds of countries, looked at this video.
And three years later, this video takes thousands of views every month.
Even kids who don't even can see, smile when they hear human voice.
"I'm Michael Shermer. I'm born a skeptic magazine, director of the Society of Skeptics."
We study suspicions about paranormal events, psevdo-elm, interest groups and winds. These are science, psevdo-elm, non-alm, tullant science, wudu-elm, telepathy science, bad science and so forth.
If you're not living at Mars last time, then you're often confronted with things like this.
Some of them call us a poet in negative sense.
But let's suppose car capture has a lot of things.
We're as a police officer, and we find them, and we're like Rallf Neydry of bad ideas. (Laughter) We want to change bad ideas with good ideas.
I'm going to show you an example of a bad mind.
I've done it with myself. It's given us for a test to the NBC Dateline.
"Quadro is a company in North Virginia."
"It's called ""Quadro 2000 Explorerbox.""
(Laughter) They sold this for $9,000 to school leaders.
It's a plastic thing on top of the Radio Shack antenne.
It can be used to look for a lot of things from the searchable device, but it's just like the student to look for marijuana in the cafeteria.
(Laughter) So it works like this: If you're going to go back to the coffee when you sit in the cortisol, you open the coffee.
That's something.
I'll show you.
(Laughter) Hmm. It's a little fruit of turning back to right.
We're going to try again because we're scientifically doing this.
We're sure we'll go to this side.
(Laughter) Thank you, you've left your cows. (Laughter)
Of course, the question is: can this tool find marijuana in the boxes?
And the key is, yes, if you open the coffee yet, you can find it.
(Laughter) (Applause) We have to follow not only what we find in science, but also what we don't find.
And the point that's open to my short talk here, probably, is that astrologists, astrologists and extraterrestres always use it.
People remember what they find, they forget they don't find.
We're telling everything in science. We compare the number of random and targets.
And that's what we did here.
We took two boxes, one of them into the official registration of CG marijuana, and one of them was empty.
And 50 percent of the tests were successful. (Laughter) We're also getting this result when the cockroach dad.
This was an interesting, small example of things we did.
The "Skeptic" magazine is published in three months. Every article has a subject.
This is about the future of poverty.
Is it smart or not when people go?
I have a certain idea about this, and I see, when people go, they're thinking.
Every ten years, average IQ has increased three numbers.
It's very interesting.
Don't think skepticism or scientific matter.
Are science and religion in harmony?
It's like to ask science about the harmony of the sanal cockroach.
These are two different things.
Science is not education, it's activity.
It's hard to think about generations.
It's the way to discover natural explanations for all the phenomenons.
"What do you think is more true? Is there a way away from the Earth's galaxies or many-dimensional creatures, making Bob's coffee field in Canada for a sceptic.com advertisement?"
Or does one of the skeptic readers make it with the Photoshop?
And the question is, in some way, what's the answer to what's real?
Before we say something is relevant to another world, we should be sure it's not from this world.
"What's more real? How can Arnold help astronauts to be a cyborg?"
(Laughter) So this is what happened in the cartoon of Sydney Harry.
"For those who stay in the archipelago, I read, ""Now a miracle happens."
"Well, you have to explain the second step better."" This slide destroys all the smart design designs."
That's what this cartoon does.
(Applause) You can say that you're a leader, but it doesn't explain anything. It doesn't put an idea in the middle.
There's nothing to hate.
For smart designers, it's the end of the dispute.
Because the East is paid, scientists sometimes call invisible things like dark energy, dark matter, until they understand what it's, they call it.
This is the beginning of the open window for science.
And for smart design, it's the end of the window.
The same question is again. What's more true?
Are the U.N. the cars of alien beings or the gravity or the explosion?
This is a picture of a U.N., which was taken from my home in Atlanta to Pasan, California.
This guy looks like a cockroach, right? That's because it's a cockroach.
"Nothing ""Photoshop," high technology, computer doesn't need."
"I've taken this picture with a code instamatic device."
Someone left the cockroach ready.
The camera was also ready — that's how much.
(Laughter) You can think some of them are real, although most of them are kept or illusion.
If we take more common, we're always looking for a line between evidence and theory.
For example, when Galaxies directed the telescope to Saturn, there were two problems.
First, there was no theory about planetary galaxies.
Secondly, let's hold and hold the evidence, so he couldn't immediately understand what he saw.
"And he wrote his observations like this: "I noticed that the distant planet was made of three bodies.""
He decided that it was what he saw.
So, without good planetary ethic theory, you can't form good theory with improbable data.
That's what happened until 1655.
This is a page of the book that Christian Huygens collaps the dragonflies that people have to understand Saturn.
These two things were known to Huygens, and there was a good theory about planets and the solar system, and there was more precise telescope data, so we realized that the Kepler's rules explode the Earth faster than Saturn.
With this telescope, we could see the angles of the galaxy.
And that's a threat to the theory.
The bad part of the theory is that it can be full of scientific challenges.
One of the reasons why people believe in the strange things is that we only have and understand them, and then I'm going to touch them very seriously.
We were eager to see the face everywhere.
It's in Mars.
In 1976, NASA wanted to take other pictures of the same place, and people thought that it was in the umbrella that was created by marks.
Here's a picture recently taken in 2001, OK.
If you cut your eyes, you can split your face again.
When you cut your eyes, you make the precise image a more unusual image, so you reduce the quality of the data.
And if I don't tell you where you have to look, you'll see the face because we've evolved and adapted to know the face.
The hands are important for us in social terms.
And, of course, smiling faces. It's easy to see all kinds of faces.
Here you see a smile face in Mars.
(Laughter) If astronomers were building, they would also see the Kermity to the Koran.
Look. Have you ever seen the minds of a little bit?
Or if the geologists were crazy.
religion icons.
(Laughter) In 1996, he found a pencil in Tennessee.
He bought five dollars from those who wanted to see the rapper, until Rahib received a notice from the village of Terez.
Here's the Bakery Guadalupe and Watsonville, down on the street, or it's the bottom street?
The tree tree tree is very good for this, because there are patterns of colored, colored, white flowers, and as you see these pictures on it — humans are animals that draw a picture.
This is the Miracle Mary outside the window in San Paul.
Here, I'm showing the face of the mirror Mary on a peninsula, and I'm going to touch it on a cassino in Las Vegas. Yes, here's America.
(Laughter) Casino paid 28 500 dollars to buy this sender from the eBay. (Laughter)
So what do you think now? Look at Mary? (Laughter)
The boxes were bleeding, which was the place in 1940s.
I'm going to look at Clearwater in Florida.
I went to myself to see this.
There were many people.
There's a lot of faithful people who come with real Arabs, with golf trees.
We were much closer interested.
Because you know the size — we've been standing with this image of Dawkins and I and the wonderful Rand, which is two, two and a half floor.
Thousands of dragonflies, in respect of people.
We went and looked at the back to understand what happened.
You don't say, there's a picture in places with fontane and palm tree.
And this is the picture of the Miracle Mary on the other side. They started to look at it.
However, most of a building can be a miracle.
(Laughter) Is this really a miracle of Mary now, or a Marge miracle? (Laughter)
And I'm going to take another example about it, and I'm going to end with a series of illusions.
There's a movie called ""The Voice,"" and Maykl Kiton is playing, and the dead tells us how to talk to us."
When the Earth comes, talking to the dead doesn't really matter so much difference.
It seems that everyone can speak.
It's the answer of the dead that's hard.
(Laughter) In this movie, these messages are hidden in electronic events.
I upload them from a website called reverse Speech.com.
This is the most famous.
This is a beautiful sound of that famous song.
(Laughter) If you're older, don't worry.
May Kenyan's summer is clean.
It's time to change the way, although two ways are separate.
Now, let's sound a translator. Look at this word, can you hear a hidden message?
(Music and incomprehensible words) [Satan] — The satan
(Music and incomprehensible words) What did you hear? Recording: The satan!
Dead? You can't hear the little bit of the devil.
Now, I'm going to tell you what you need to hear the listening part of your brain and listen again.
I'm going to end with a little, beautiful and meaningful story.
"Skeptics" is an untypical nonprofit organization."
We're often looking for good things that people do now.
In England, there's a pop singer.
Now it's very popular in England: it's called Katie Melua.
There's a very beautiful song.
"It was one of the best five songs in 2005, called ""Ghost's Twenty million bicycles."" It's a love story — Britain's love story — Norah Jones. His loved boy is right to love even two million bicycles."
There's a part of it in words.
(Music) We've been 12 billion light years away from the universe. It's dark. Nobody says that it's true. But I can say that I'll be with you for a lifetime.
Spiker: Yeah. It's at least the nearest number.
"In America, it would be ""We're six thousand light years away."" (Laughter) My friend Simon Singh, a particle physicist. It's a scientist, and it's the author of the book ""Big Bang."" That's worth all the opportunities for good scientific stimulation."
"So, in the Guardian, he wrote a article about Katie's song, and he said, we know exactly how far we are from the desert."
We're not 12 years away, 13,7 billion light years away, and it's not sure.
We know exactly how much it's possible, if it's a little mistake.
So, if we're not completely correct, we can say that it's very close to the right number.
The wonder is that after the publication of his writing, Kate called him, and he said, I was very embarrassed, and I was a member of the astronomical club.
I didn't have to keep the way. He also wrote his song.
And I'm going to end with this.
(Music words) We've been 13,7 billion light years away from the limit of the universe to be a witness.
It might be a real advantage, but it's the nearest calculated number.
And in terms of information in our hand, I predict that I'll always be with you.
(Laughter) Well, isn't you?
(Applause)
In the 1980s, in communist East Germany, if you had a written machine, you had to register it.
The example of a text written in the machine had to register.
So the government knew the source of all the texts.
When they found a paper that invented an old mind, they could find the writer of this mind.
And we thought this thing in the West was impossible, a huge threat to express freedom.
We never allowed it in our own countries.
But today, in 2011, if you take something to print a laser print device of any famous mark, it will automatically print the yellow points of the left-handed tape that's just your printer, and that's going to distinguish your printer from others.
This is our reality today.
Nobody makes it fun.
This is an example of what our government uses technology against us — our citizens.
This problem is one of three basic online problems.
And when we look at the problems online, we see the attacks that are happening by certain groups.
These attackers are divided into three key groups.
First, they're criminals online.
In this way, as Dmitry Golubov, from Kiev, Ukraine.
And it's not too hard to understand why criminals lose crime.
These people earn money.
Very often, they're fighting online attacks to get a lot of money.
In fact, we've seen millions of people who have attacked online, multimillioners.
This is Vladimir Tsasts from Tartu in Estonia.
This is Alfred Gonzalez.
This is Stephen Watt.
This is Bjorn Sundin.
This is Matthew Anderson and Tariq Al- Daour. It can also extend the black.
These people earn their services online, but they do it in illegal ways, they use things like banking viruses to save money from our bank accounts when we operate online, or when we buy a virus computer online, they collect credit card information with keybooks.
Two months ago, the U.S. secret service organ broke the Swiss bank account of a person named Sam Jain on this picture, which had 14.9 million US dollars when it blew.
Nobody knows where Sam Je's.
I think today, the possibility of being a crime in the online continent is bigger than the true world.
And it seems clearly that when the situation goes, it gets worse.
In the future, the biggest mass of crimes will happen online.
The second big group of attacks online is not money.
And the reasons why they want to do this can be violence, freedom of mind, smile.
Groups like Anonymous grew up for the last year, and they started to place on the basis of attacks on the Internet.
I counted two of the three main attackers: these are criminals that do this for money, hackers like an Anonymous to protest, and the third main force is the government and the governments.
Let's look at what happens in companies like DigiNotar.
It's a typical example of what governments are doing when they attack their citizens.
DigiNotar is a certificate discovery in Netherlands — more true — it was.
In the last year, they've been infected by online cells.
Someone came into the systems, and all the systems exploded.
And in a refugee last week, I asked the Dutch government officials, and I asked one of the government officials, and I didn't believe that DigiNotar was a human death.
He said he believed.
How do people die by such an attack?
DigiNotar is an online certificate Association.
They sell the certificate online.
What do they do with certificates?
If you have a website based on Internet, and if you want to use a Secure Secure Service like Gma, you need this certificate.
We use more than the Gmail or the search services, but it's much more popular in countries like Iran, whereas people in these countries use more than the foreign services like the Gmail, because they can't control local government emails than they've been encrypted as an SSL encryption.
But that's the external certificate that offers such services.
It's possible by distributing the website of the companies.
And that was what happened to the DigiNotar company.
What about the Arab Bahrain and what happens in Egypt?
In Egypt, in April 2011, prisoners invented the center of the Secret Police of Egypt, and they invented a lot of document when they search for it.
"In these papers, there was a file called ""FINFISHER."" And in this file, there were records of a company that was in Germany, and the company sold tools and programs to the Egyptian government to preserve all the communication tools of citizens in general."
These tools sold to the Egyptian government to 280,000 euros.
The center of the company is completely here.
In short, the Western governments provide devices that allow the total governments to control their citizens.
But the Western governments do this for their own citizens.
For example, a few weeks ago, there was a virus called the State Virus in Germany, which was created for three to investigate their citizens by the German government.
If you're punished by any string, everybody knows that your phone is listened.
Now it's already about it.
They're going to follow your Internet connection.
They can guide the government virus to your computer, control all your relationships, listen to your online conversations, learn your passwords.
"When many people talk about things like this, it's probably a lot of chance to answer, ""OK, it's not a good job, but I'm a citizen who respects the law, it doesn't have a lot of impact on me."
Why should I be worried?
"I don't have anything wrong."" But that's a very random idea."
Privacy is a condition.
It's not about music.
It doesn't matter the choice between security and corruption.
It's about the choice between freedom and surveillance.
And that's what we believe in our government today in 2011, and that's what we're going to reject any rights.
But can we believe our eyes in the future, like the next 50 years, in our government?
And the questions and questions like this must have things that will hurt us in the next 50 years.
(Music) (Applause) Thank you for being here.
"And I say, ""Thank you for being here,"" because I was in a box for 17 years."
(Laughter) And I said that I'd come to the 20th anniversary of the Earth World in Washington DC.
My family and my friends fell together to listen to me.
"I said, ""I'm glad you're here,"" and my mother said, ""He speaks to Helen, Johnny.""
(Laughter) Imagine what you're staying in a cave for 17 years, and imagine your mother's kind of living behavior.
"My father said to me, ""That's the only thing."" I'm going to understand it."
I looked around, because I couldn't understand where my voice came.
"I didn't hear my voice for 17 years, and I looked around me and said, "God, who is what I think?""
And then I realized that I was myself and I was smiling.
"My father said, ""Yes, he's also fun."" Now I want to take you into this journey."
And even though it's an extraordinary journey, it's all of us.
I believe you can be a metaphor for our journey, and I also want you to never think about your journey.
My journey begins since 1971, when I witnessed the collision of two oil tankers under the Golden Gate, then a half million gallons exploded by oil.
And it made me so much impact that I decided to not use engine transport tools.
This is a big thing for California.
And this was also a big thing for the small Point Reyes station I lived in Inverness, where 350 people lived in the winter of 71-year.
And when I came here, I started to go to the beach, people — they knew what happened.
"And they asked me, ""John, what do you do?"" And I said, ""I walk in a picnic environment," they said, ""No, you're doing that to hate us, right?""
"You're doing this to don't bring you bad yet."" Maybe they were right, I thought people would join me when I went to the cat."
Because it's all about oil falling on the ocean.
He spoke, and I was arguing with people about this.
I call my parents.
"And I said, ""I don't use cars anymore."" My father said, ""Did you do this when you were 16 years old?"" (Laughter) I didn't know about the environment at that time."
They lived in Philadelphia.
"I said to my mother, ""I'm very happy for everything,"" He said, ""If you're excited, you don't need to tell it."" Mother's case."
So, at my 27th birthday, I decided that — because I had a lot of disputes, and I talked a lot — I decided that I would stop talking about it just a day, a day.
So I did this.
I didn't talk a talk when I woke up tomorrow.
And I'm saying that it's a great experience for me because for the first time I started listening to that long time.
And when I heard, it made me feel.
Because I always thought I was listening to people, and when I listened to people, I thought they wanted to talk about, I didn't listen to them anymore.
And when I spoke to people, I went forward to them, and when they spoke, I thought about what they would say.
And then ...
So the communication ended.
And that day I really heard.
And it was hard for me because I realized that I've learned something in these years.
I was 27 years old, and I thought I knew everything.
But I didn't know.
So I examined this for the next day, and then again and this time, and I promised myself that I would be in a prison for a year because I started learning, and I needed it.
So, I didn't talk a year, and at that time, at my name day, I thought I could start to talk again about some of the things I learned.
But it took this speed for 17 years.
I went to the stage for 17 years, and I worked on the board, and I also worked on writing my art and my day, trying to study the entire engineering book.
And I thought I needed education.
I went to Athens, Oregon, and there were education programs for environment.
It's about 800 kilometers.
I went to the entrance office, and ... what?
I've shown the message in the newspaper.
Oh, do you want to read here when you're born?
Talk ...?
We have a special software for you. They did it.
And then, two years later, I ended up with a bachelor rate.
My father came. He proud of me.
"He said, ""Hey, my son, we honor you, but we don't know what to do with this bachelor degree.""
"You're not driving the car, you're not talking, you're going to do it."" (Laughter) (Laughter) I've taken my flower, and I started to go back."
I came to Port Townshend, Washington, and I made it back from the tree, and I moved it through Puget sound, from Idaho to Washington, and from there to Misoula to Montana.
Two years ago, I invited the University of Montana, and I loved this.
It didn't be bad to stay here for two years.
(Laughter) And that's what happened. I studied at university for two years.
There are two stories in Montana.
The first thing is that when I came here, my money disappeared.
"And they said, ""Don't worry about it."" The manager of the program said, ""Come back tomorrow."" He gave me 150 dollars and said, ""Go to register for a lesson."
"You're going to South America, right?"" I said to him — Sky and stars, hydrogen systems, South America."
So I did that.
"He went back and said to me, ""OK, John, you can take the office open and use the library as a student."
And we're going to allow you all professors to participate in their class.
"Let's be easy to take a piece, and the rest of thing to solve, and you can check out, and then take it."" Yes, it's not usually done in the magistrate."
They wanted to help me was big.
They saw that there was a lot of my environment, and they tried to help me on this path.
In this period, I've also done lessons without talking.
When I first went to the classroom, I had 13 students.
He translated my friend to them what they understood with their hand signs: the name is John Francisco, I'm going to the cat, and I told them that it won't be translated — that's the last lesson.
All of the students around are ...
(Laughter) (Laughter) So, I've seen the winds of time to get out quickly.
But I had to tell them that voice.
Two weeks later, everyone tried to go to our village.
I learned a lot in this class — when I did these kinds of movements.
And I'm not aware that it's a little bit of what John says — I don't know, I think it's going to break the tree. Yes, it's cut the tree.
No, no. It's not that — it's the use of a hand screw.
You cut your hand with a knife.
You can cut it out.
No, he speaks of selection machine.
So this was an argument, and we talked about it.
I've taken back from this job and say I've gone away.
But what I learned was, sometimes when they showed a sign, they sounded the sense I didn't really predict, but I had to predict it.
And I thought, if you're a teacher and you're educating, and if you don't learn yourself, you don't have to teach well.
So I continued.
"He came to my father's release event, and my father said to me and my father, ""We thank you, but ..."" And you know the result, he said, ""You have to start driving and talk to a car."
"What do you think about doing with the Master's degree?"" I took my Chinese, threw my bag out and went to the University of Wisconsin."
And I went there for two years, writing about oil tolls.
Nobody was interested in oil imports.
But something happened — Exxon Valdez.
And I was the only person who wrote about oil imports in the U.S.
My father came again.
"He said, ""I don't know how this is doing, ""You don't use the machine, you don't talk."
"My father said, ""You need to leave you, because you look better things you're putting down."" (Laughter) I got my pocket back."
I took my bath, and went to the Eastlands, and I put my feet into the Atlantic Ocean, which took seven years and a day to move the U.S. head alone.
And in 1990, I started to blow the Earth Earth on the 20th anniversary of the day.
So I used those dragonflies, because when the trees fall on the tree, there's no one who heard that, then it's not a voice.
And I thanked the soldiers and my family because they came to hear me.
And that's the connection.
And they taught me to listen — they heard me.
And that's something that doesn't come from that box — listening to each other.
It's really important — we need to listen to each other.
My journey continued.
"My father said, ""It's the only thing,"" and I didn't have to do it yet."
I've worked as a Saharan Guard, and I've been the United Nations's Favorite Tour.
I wrote the rules for the U.S. — the rules for oil imports.
"20 years ago, if someone said to me, "John, do you want to make a difference from the birth?""
"Yes, I want to make a difference."
"And they would say, ""Come up to my right place, fall out of the car and start to my right place."" And then they would say, ""Well, let's take you."" (Laughter) My friend, you want to separate.""
How does that happen? How?
How can you distinguish with simple things like walking and talking to the store?
The Saharan protection period passed very well.
"And then — I worked here just a year — and I said, ""Well, it's a year to do this."" I took a long return and went to the Gulf of the Caraibe until I went to Venice, all the islands in the army."
I've got to remember the key thing — I've got to tell you why I started talking to you.
I started to talk, and I learned the dark environment engineering.
I learned the environment engineering at this level — formal level, but there was a non-formal surface.
(Laughter) And non-formal intelligence — that was what I learned about people, what we do, and we're crazy.
And the environment changed not only because of trees and birds, but not for the species that are dangerous, but because of our relationship with each other.
And if we look at the environment at all around us, we see our behavior to ourselves and each other.
And that was the inventor I wanted to transmit.
"And I said, ""I have to transmit this inventor to other people,"" and I was sitting in the loop of the career — that was my own source, and I worked on it — I went to Venice and started to go."
This is the end of the story, and I realized that I wasn't going to come there because I still didn't use the car.
I went through El Dorado — here's a famous prison city, or a peninsula prison — in Venice, and I don't know what happened to me because I wasn't at myself.
"And when he went through the protective room, he kept me and said, ""Pasaaporte, pasaporte"" and M16 brought me up."
"And I said to her, ""Well, passport?"
I don't have to show you a pass, it's my bag.
I went around the world to Sri Lanka, PhD Francisco, and I left the rate.
What caused me to tell it?
The road turned into the prison.
They didn't smile me.
I was free, and thanking God because I was free, what do I say?
When I went 150 kilometers across, I realized that I was transformed into my heart, including a space.
I was in prison and I had to escape from there.
I didn't use military transport tools was the prison I was inside.
What's happening?
Because when I started, it looked like it was okay to use the car.
But the difference was that I've ever wanted to take myself out every day, but I never wanted to use my feet.
That's how I didn't think I was going to be in Sierra Leone.
I didn't think I wasn't a professor.
And so I realized that I only had other responsibilities than myself, and that's why I had to change.
You know, we can do it.
I had to change.
And I was afraid of changing because I always learned to go and go.
Because I learned to a prison who didn't want his end.
I didn't know who I would be when I walk.
But I knew that was necessary.
I knew that I needed to change, because it was the only way to be here today.
And I know, very often, we find ourselves somewhere we want to stay forever, but there are places to go for us.
And we have to go back to where we're going to have a new identity.
And I want to thank you for not going to that next place — take you out of the prison where you can come out of the prison that's as comfortable as possible. We need to do things on this path today.
We have to change now.
As our previous Vice President said, we should be happy.
And if my voice affects you, if my lives affect you, please do that if I'm affected you if I'm here.
I know that when I'm here, you can all influence me.
Let's come to the flag — let's come out of the world, take this love, take this respect with us — and here's the relationship we show each other at TED.
Because we're environment engineers and our mutual behavior means our behavior in our environment.
So, because you're here, I'm going to thank you, and I'd like to end my journey here with five seconds.
Thank you.
(Applause)
"I think you stand on any street in America, and a Japanese comes to you and says, "Look, what's the name of this block?""
"And you're saying, ""It's the Oak Street, and it's the Science Street."
"It's 26th, it's 27th."" He says, ""Well, what's the name of this block?"" You say, ""Not the name of the block."
"It's called a little bit, and the blocks are just the unknown group between the streets."" It's just looking for you in a little shame and confusion."
"So let's imagine if you stand on a street in Japan, and you turned to my name, "Look, what's the name of this street?""
"He says, ""This block is 17 and that block is 16,"" And you're saying, ""What's the name of the street?"" He says, ""No names of the street."
The blocks have names.
Look at Google Maps. There are 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 blocks here.
These are all the names of blocks, and these are the unknown groups between the blocks.
"And you say, ""Well, how do you define your home address?"" He says, ""No easy. This is the eighth ray."
"And you're still asking the block 17 and the house number 1, ""OK. I've looked at it when I sat around it,"" he says, ""Oh, they're going, they're going, they're fundamentally rediscovered by history."
The number of the first house in the block is one.
It's two of the second numbers that have been built after that.
"It's simple. It's simple and smart."" Sometimes I love it most, we have to go to the one part of the world to see that most of us can't be right to understand what we never thought."
For example, the doctors in China think they're going to keep you safe.
In the months you apologize, you pay to the doctors, and if you're sick, you don't pay any money, because they didn't come back to their job, they're getting time you're healthy, because you're sick.
"In many music, we think we're going to start with one, two, three."
"The Amma in Western Africa shows the end of the musical part, like the end of a sentence."
So, it's not just when you split it into particles, but when you see it, two, three, four, one.
And this map is true.
Smiling I'm saying that what you can do about India is that it's true.
So, let's never forget, if you have a good idea at TED or elsewhere, or you've heard, the way that can be right.
Domo arigato gozaimashita. (Thank you. Japanese)
