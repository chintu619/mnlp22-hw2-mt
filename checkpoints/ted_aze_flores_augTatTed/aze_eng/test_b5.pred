I'm going to talk about unexpected discovery today.
I'm working in solar technology industry now.
And my little beginning point is to bring us into force, and it's also ...
(Laughter) So he looked at different sources for that.
It's just a little video about what we're doing.
(Laughter) Just a minute.
It can lead to a little bit of time.
(Laughter) We're just going to pass this part — I'm going to pass through the part of the video just ... (Laughter)
No. (Laughter) (Laughter)
(Music) That's not ... (Laughter)
Well. (Laughter)
Solar technology.
Oh, has my time ended?
Well. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So I want you to focus on what you're doing.
And we're going to go back for a few minutes later, and I hope if you learn to control your body slightly, it will change your life very much.
We're very interested in body language, especially in body language of others.
There's a lot of things that are interested in: (Laughter) something simple like unconsciousness or smile, unbelievable perspective or fear, or even tightness of the hand.
East: Here they're going to come to a 10-inch house.
This lucky police pulls the hand of the president of the U.S.
We're hungry. We're collecting ourselves.
We're crying.
We're trying to be invisible for the person around us.
As you see, animals and humans do the same things.
And when you meet the strong and the weak, it looks like this.
When we're sure that it's coming, we're usually prepared to complete the gestures of others.
So if someone uses power against us, we're trying to collect. We don't replicate his gestures.
Instead, we're going to follow his power.
I saw that the students of the MA show a lot of power stones.
Some of them take themselves as a leader, and when they go into the classroom, they go right in the middle of the workshop, they go on their place before they start learning yet.
When they go, they take almost two people.
They raise their hands in this way.
I made some results for myself.
The first is probably not going to surprise you.
It's calculated that it's about violence.
So women follow this blood more than men.
Women usually feel weak than men, and it's not surprising.
And it's very important for the students of the MA, because it affects their education prices.
Business schools are always fighting gender differences.
Men and women, who are at the same level, get different prices at the end of the course, and it seems to be related to the involvement.
And I started thinking about myself, and we're going to see that those who come in this way are more active in the classroom.
So if they show them, if they want them to take them out of these kinds of copies, will they participate more effectively in the classroom?
So if we show ourselves strong for a short time, can we feel stronger as a result of our behavior change?
Now we know that our eses and our machines define thinking and parts of others about us, and there's a lot of evidence.
But the question that really cares for us is that these gestures and techniques don't affect ourselves.
That's what happens in both ways.
It's also about power.
When we feel strong and confident, we're fruit of gestures that show more power, but when we try to become stronger, we feel strong.
What do I say when I think about power?
I talk about thinking and particles, and about physiological things that form them, and for me, these are hormones. I study hormones.
What does it distinguish the minds of the weak with the forces?
And that's only 60 percent of those in the power position, and that's a very important difference.
And that's what we've found in testosterone.
As soon as they came, I grew up with 20% on testosterone that passed through the power experiment, and in others, there was a 10% increase.
These changes can be done for almost two minutes.
And that's what happens in cortisol.
It's about 25 percent in the cortisol of those in the power position, and there's 15 percent in the other parts.
Almost two minutes, these harmonical changes lead our brains to feel more assertive, healthier and comfortable, or stressed and closed.
These particles meet us all, right?
So our body language defines how we think and feel about ourselves, so nonverbals are not just for others.
Another body also changes our mind.
And the next question that we're interested is that we're going to change our life for a few minutes of power position.
This is a two-minute experiment that happened in the laboratory.
So where can this be applied in real life?
Of course, that's what we're really interested in.
In fact, these positions can be used to be used to measure situations that make a social threat.
Where are we usually measured?
This is the back table for newborns.
For some people, it's a school meeting.
It's a call for some people or a talk like this, or a job interview.
We thought that most of you were interested in a product interview because most of you had an experience.
So we published our findings, and the media interviewed them, and what the jusrillists said, "We have to do when we go to a job interview?"
(Laughter) Of course, we rejected this idea. No! Of course, we didn't predict it.
It's absurd to do this!
It's not with your other people.
It's important to communicate with you.
What do you do before you start an interview?
You're sitting. You're looking at iPhone or Android.
You're looking at your notes, you're collapsing, you're collecting yourself, and it's probably what you're going to do, as you're sitting on the feet, stay exactly like this.
That's what we wanted to hate.
They went to the laboratory, and they went through a very intense work interview after they received power and power points.
The interview was filmed for five minutes.
They were taught to use a nonverbally tool to prevent the effects of the audience. They looked like this.
In five minutes, looking at an emotionally inaccessible face is much easier than asking questions.
Nobody likes it.
Marianne La France calls it "Stop in social battle," which increases cortisol level in the human.
We took them from a interview to see the results.
And then we showed them four of these pictures.
They were unknowable from the east, from our expectations.
When they looked at the video, they said, "We want to take them to work," they showed people who had a high-power position.
"We don't want to take them into work.
"And the previous ones are more positive."" What does it really affect?"
It's not because they're saying.
It's because it's connected to them.
And we looked at their other indicators, for example, how big are the scores?
What benefits do you have?
There was no difference between these indicators.
These were not the main effects.
People just showed their real face.
So they did show themselves.
They didn't imagine their minds, they showed themselves.
It's almost affected by this factor.
"And when I say to the people that our body can change our minds, our behavior, and our behavior, and say, ""Is this not a little preservation?"" And I."
I'm saying to simulate until you reach the reality.
"""I'm not like this."
I don't want to realize something and feel stupid.
I don't want to be a lawyer.
"I don't want to be where I'm not alive.""
"I understand these words very well. I want to tell you a little story about the feeling of ""I'm not my place.""
When I was 19 years old, I had a very heavy car crash.
He was shot from a car to a desert.
I turned out there a couple of times.
I played a great brain disorder in the rehabilitation department, I had to leave the college, and I told me that I was down at the level of GDP at two points, which was very painful for me.
I got an IQ because I became a kid who was intelligent and willing.
Because I was released from college, I tried to come back.
They said to me, "You won't finish the college.
There's a lot of things you can eat, but college industry isn't — and I started to fight it, and I've just started to say, that your essential property that you have was, for me, that's a sense, nothing can weak you as you get from your hand.
I felt completely weak.
I worked, I worked, I worked on my face, and I got a failure.
I ended the college soon.
"I had to spend four years from my group colleagues, and I agreed Susan Fisher, who was a adviser, to take me to Princeton University, so I found, ""I'm not a parent.""
I was drunk.
This is my first 20 minutes of course that 20 people heard in Princeton.
It was the first night.
I was so scared that I would open the morning, and I call my head and said, "I won't go."" He said to me, "No, if you're going to do, I've got a flower at your bar.
You're going to stay and you're going to tell me.
Even if it's cold.
You're going to do all the results you have to do.
Again, again, you're afraid, and you're scared, so if your body doesn't listen to you, "Not done. I'd like!
"It's really coming from my hand."" You're going to work until you're going to say."" I did that."
For five years, I've read the high level of an old school, and for a few years, I've moved to Northwest, I'm working there, and I don't think about it, but for a long time, I thought, "I'm not my place."
And at the end of the first year I was in Harvard, my student came to my cabinet, who said, "You're going to participate in the workshop, or you're going to cut off."
And in a completely troubled situation, he went into her, and he said, "This is not my place."
It's a turning point for me.
Because two things happened.
First, I realized that I didn't longer pass that sense.
But he felt, and those particles knew me.
Secondly, I realized that he was right.
So he could be able to simulate.
And I said to him, "Hey, here's the whole art!
(Applause) I said, "I'm going to show yourself out of the morning, it's going to show yourself strong, and you're going to come into the classroom and give the best gift that you've given today."" And he did that, and they didn't know that the rabbits were there, they didn't know he was here." (Laughter) A few months later, he came to me and I saw her sister, not until she felt true, but that she was really imitation.
He changed.
I would like to tell you that, too.
Imagine it until it's true.
Show yourself until you want to be one.
I want you to know that.
Simple corrections can bring so big changes.
Now, it's two minutes that I said earlier.
Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.
Take it for two minutes before a situation you're going to be measured once again, in the elevator, in the room, behind the table or behind the door.
Take what you want to do.
Wait for your brain to make the best thing in the situation.
increase your testosterone, and reduce your cortisol.
""Well, I couldn't show them what I was capable."" Don't let it end with perseverance."
"Look, ""I'm going to reach them and show them what I'm!""
I want you to share it with other people, because it's very simple.
(Laughter) Pay this information and share it with people, because people who can do it are usually people who have no technology and resources, no status and no confidence.
Pay it with them so you can use it by someone.
Because only two minutes of attention to their bodies can significantly affect their lives.
Thank you.
(Applause).
We have many fans in the world.
The most thickness between their supergles is invisible.
For example, catadores, they're employers that collect recycled materials to live.
Catadores have a hard, honest and necessary job that gives everyone a benefit, but they don't thank them for it.
Here, in Brazil, 90 percent of the products that will be recycled — what they collect.
Most of the catadores work independent.
Carroces are Arabs or metals that are made of a tape or a wall in a couple of cities in Brazil, and remember gravity or small art.
And that's why I meet these super-created characters.
I'm a graphist and an activist, and my works are basically about the protection of social, politics and the environment.
In 2007 I turned my job towards the city's life to quarks from the wall to the wall.
But this time, I supported catalors.
And it took more attention to my work to mix art and egg, and it helped them bring these catadores into the center of focus and raise their confidence in themselves.
They're famous today in the streets in the press and in social media.
In fact, since I met this world, I've always worked in this field.
I got more than 200 cars in many cities, and I invited many tourists and tourists in the world.
I realized that the catadores with invisibility don't belong only to Brazil.
I found them in Argentina, China, South Africa, Turkey, even Japan and the U.S. developed countries.
And then, I realized that more people should be involved in this case, because it was a big job.
"And then, I created a movement under the head of ""Because My Carrocha."" (Laughter) It's a movement that can be financially funded by the public."
Thank you.
(Applause)
"It was a great crowd of people who helped him to help the catadores and the quarks, ""Because the Carrocha.""
Catadores supported by doctors, dentisters, pedestrians, hairstyleists, mass therapists, and so well-known professionals and healthcare services.
Also, when quarks were built by our corroses, they gave them help to see well the beach and the city that didn't rains, the protective wings.
They also took other tools for security: amino acids, patterns and mirror.
Finally, they were crying by the street artists, and they became part of this wonderful and big ship ship ship.
""Because I'm beautiful."" He went out to San Paul, Rio de Janeiro and the streets of Kuwait."
"And we inspired TEDx to inspire the city outside Brazil, and we created a Pimpx version that was created by people who was facilitated and funded and liberated by the people."
So everyone could join.
"In two years, 170 catadores, 800 volunteers and 200 miles, and more than 1,000 donors were joined in the ""Carrocha Miracle," and they were trained to repatriate in local schools with their help."
Now, catadores were people who were respected and valued when they left the invisibility.
Because of their wonderful corroses, they could come up with courageous ideas, they could increase their revenues and their relationship with society.
Now, I invite you to find Catadores and other invisible super heroes in your city and recognize them.
Try to see the world as a whole without limits and curves.
If you want to believe, there are more than 20 million catadores in the world.
So when you see one next time, know them as part of our community's life.
Much orbigado, thank you.
(Applause)
On 5 November 1990, a person called Al-Syyid Nosair, went to a hotel in Manhattan and moved to Ravvin Meir Kahane, the leader of the Guard League of Jews.
He was innocent from the death of Nosair, but when he was punished for gravity, he had a number of prison agencies in New York with other criminals, including the tunels, the Senegales and the headquarters of the U.N.
Luckily, plans were underestimated by the FTB staff.
But unfortunately, in 1939, the World Trade Center couldn't prevent bombing.
And finally, Nosair could be angry in the southwest.
Al-Syyid Nosair is my father.
In 1982, in Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, in Pennsylvania, I looked forward to the world as a child of a mysterious American and compassionate American teacher of math class. They didn't have to come out of my hands to live a happy child.
When I was seven years old, my relationship began to change.
My father led me to see that many Muslims, including many Muslims, are a very little person's witness.
And I've learned this from my life experience: after people get enough familiar with each other, it doesn't have a long time to understand that each other is the same expectations of life.
In every single continent, in every nation, there's a little bit of people who feel the damage to their faith and their own lives to drive others.
A couple of months ago, my father stood in front of me and told me that they went to policing training at London in the last few weeks.
And I said I'm going to go with him tomorrow.
We arrived to the Colliderton Collider, and at that time, we didn't know that there was a CIA secret evidence.
When my dad came to me, my father helped me keep the pen in my flower and understood how to target the pencil of 30 meters.
The last pink lamp that I put on that day came out of the tiny orange lamp on the sky, and it was collapsed, and everybody surprised that, especially I.
And I went to other men and said, "Ibn Abuh," he said, "It's the fish of his father."
Everyone smiled, but a few years later, I realized what they really laughed.
They thought that my father was powerful, and the terrible thing I could see.
Lastly, these people were familiar with the furk of about 700 kilos of explosive matter, which was exploded by the Earth's Department of Commerce, underneathing the North Pole, because six people died and more than 1,000 people ran.
And this is what I've taken to me.
"OK."" They were people I called Amy.
As I was 19 years old, we changed our life 20 times, and this difference that took time for my childhood caused me to have little friends.
It was one of the things that we didn't feel close to myself and we didn't move to other cities.
I always became the goal of the kids that were used to be new at the stage.
I kept my identity hidden from my classmates to not be in the street center, but it became clear that it was enough to be the most string and top of a new student.
So I spent a lot of my time at home reading books, watching TV or playing games.
So I had problems with the skills of social communication, and I was not prepared for the real face of life, like one who grew up in a fanist family.
I grew up in a environment that was justified because of people's perception of religion and religion.
What happened when I opened my eyes?
So one of my first experiences that led me to this way of thinking was the president election of 2000.
I got the opportunity to participate in the National Young World Congress in Filadelf under the program for university preparation.
And the group I realized was based on violence between children, and as one of the people who hurt most of their lives, I wasn't going to fight the situation.
The members of our group were people who lived in different ways of life.
I learned that one of the children I met in the last days of the convention was Jewish.
This fact was only discovered for a few days, but sometimes I realized that interconnection between us was not a hostility.
He had never been a Jewish friend before, and I said that it was right, because I knew that the barry that I felt inevitable for my life.
And one more important point of return was the job I found in the busch Garden fun park in the summer.
I was in front of people from various religions and cultures, and it played a fundamental role in the expansion of this experiment.
I learned that a lot of my life was a crime of homosexuality, and in general, all the gees have a sense of meaning.
The work showed that I had the opportunity to work with gay artists in one of these shows, while many of them were the most good people I ever saw.
It's a sense that, like a very young person in the childhood, has been formed in me as a sense of suffering from others, and it's a sense that I don't want to do something that I don't want to do with other people.
As I felt this, I could compare stereotypes that were taught to me from childhood to a real life experience.
I'm unknowable how it feels to be a forest, but I'm very well familiar with what the pencil is because it doesn't matter you.
"And then, ""The Daily Show,"" John Stüart brought me to be honest with myself about my devotion to the fanalism, and he helped me understand that human moral orientation and religion and sexual orientation were not the quality of his moral orientation."
John Stüart, at the moment I needed my father, was actually giving me the meaning of the word.
The government comes from an unpredictable place, and the fact that a Jewish comedian had more positive effects on my world's view than my extreme father.
One day, I was proud of my mom and my mom, and my mother told me a word that I couldn't leave my heart for my lifetime.
My mother looked at me with the eyes of tiredness, like one who lived enough dopmatism throughout his life, and he said, "I've been tired of hate people."
In a moment, I realized how much sense of hating requires energy.
Jack Abraham is not my true name.
I changed my name when I decided to start a new life when I started my relationship with my father.
So why did I stop myself, risk it?
The door is very simple.
And I hope that maybe somebody who's violent at some point hear my story and has a difference between the way that's better, although I'm not a fanatic, I'm not going to be led to an intolerant ideology.
Instead, I decided to use my life experience as a fight against terrorism and fanalism.
And I'm going to do this for terror victims and their loved ones, the terrible pain and losses that terrorism lived for them.
I'm going to be able to criticize my father's movements because of the victims of terrorism, and not under this strange activity.
As a simple example of my talk, I'm a real hope that violence is not supposed to pass through religion and escape, and that the child doesn't have to go through his father.
I'm not like my father.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
Good morning!
Are you tired?
They took the name written on them, but I wanted to ask you, and here someone wrote the name in Arabic on his marriage?
Who wrote? Nobody? Well, there's no problem.
A while ago, one day, I sat with my friend in the restaurant and buy food.
"I looked at the office, and I said, "Do you have a mother? (Laughter)"
He looked strange at me thinking he heard the word wrong.
"He said, ""Well, look like? (In English)" I said, ""Meny, (Laughter) (Laughter) He said, ""You don't know what do they say to him?"" "Yes.""
"He said, ""No! It's called a menu or a menu."" Is my French requirement right?"
"Well, let's do this!"" He said to the office."
"He loved to talk to me, and he said to himself, "If he was the most coolest girl in this world, I wouldn't look at him!""
What's the meaning of saying ""My"" in Arabic?"
The ship told him two words that the girl of Lebanon, a young boy, was kept back and judged as ignorance.
How could he speak like this, right?
At that moment, I started thinking.
It devastated me.
It's really worth a man's mistake!
They don't accept me because they speak me in my own language.
Where can this happen elsewhere?
How did we fall here?
But we're so much here, there are many people here like me that they get a step in their own lives that they're just unimaginable to tell them that they're modern and cultural to say they are.
Should I forget all my culture, my thoughts, my mind and my memories?
Children's stories about war could be our best experiences!
I've learned Arabic just to adapt everything I've learned.
Should I forget to be one of them?
Is there an insect here?
And despite all of them, I tried to understand him.
I didn't want to judge him with the shame that he justified me.
Arabic doesn't respond to the demands of this day.
It's not the language of science, it's not the language of research, or it's not the language that we believe to introduce a large-scale research project that we're habituating at our universities, and it's not the language that we use at our airport.
If we did that, they would cut our shoes.
So where should I use my language? We all have to ask this question!
You want to use Arabic. Where should we use?
This is a reality.
But there's another more important reality that we need to think.
Arabic is the native language.
In study, you have to be perfect in your native language to be perfect in other languages.
In primary language, the perfect idea in other languages is necessary to express ideas in creative ways.
How?
When Cibran Rushmore started writing, he used Arabic when he started writing for the first time.
All his ideas, images and catastrophes were created by a little boy in the village that grew up with a particular voice heard.
So when he started writing in English, he had enough basis.
Even when he writes in English, when he read his texts, you feel that box, you pass those parts.
You can imagine that the boy from the mountains of Lebanon, who is written in English.
It's a message that nobody will argue.
Secondly, it often says that if you want to kill a nation, the only way to kill a nation is to kill his language.
It's a reality that developed communities know.
German, French, Japanese, Chinese — these nations are different from this race.
So they're prohibiting protecting their own languages.
They sanctify it.
So they're using the derivative product, they're paying a lot of money to develop language.
Do we know more than them?
Well, we aren't from the developed world, but this idea doesn't come to us yet, and we wanted to walk with the cultural world.
Sometimes, they took research for us, but for development, and they took their own languages, as countries like Turkey, Malaysia, etc, and they took their own languages, so they didn't take it.
They kept language close to themselves.
Because if you buy a product from Turkey or any other country, and there's no label on it in Turkish, so it's not a native product.
You didn't believe it was a native product.
They were a customer like the first. We're often the poor consumers as we're.
So for innovation and producing, they had to protect their own languages.
"If I say, ""Laughter, suverenity, independence,"" what will this remind you?"
Don't you remember anything, right?
Who, despite how and why it's.
Language is not just the way to get words out of our mouth, it's not the way to talk.
Language shows some stages of our life and terminology about our emotions.
"So, when we say, ""solidity, suverenity, independence,"" all of you think, there's a particular picture, in a particular history, a particular day particular particles."
Language is not a word or two or three words or a letter.
It's a internal idea about how we think, how we see each other, how others see us.
What's the invention?
How can you say that this person understands, or not?
"So if I say, ""Laughter, suverenity, independence," or if your son came to say, "Are you living in a period of freedom?""
What do you feel?
If you don't see the problem, it's good that I'm going out and I'm not going to talk to a empty place.
The idea is that these expressions remind us something special.
I have a French friend who married French.
I asked him one day how does the work work?
"He said, ""Every thing is good. But I've tried one day to translate the word "toborni" for him for a whole night."" (Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) The woman said, ""toborni"" wrongly, and then he tried to explain the word all night to him."
"He had no idea, ""How might a man be so bizarre?""
Does he want to suicide?
""It's me? (In English)" It's one of a few missions."
We started thinking that because she couldn't understand the hand, she couldn't say that word to her, and she was right to understand, and she was different.
"And my husband said to me, ""He's listening to Fair, and one night I tried to translate it to him that when I heard the fairness, he would feel that I felt that when I heard the fairness."" And the woman tried to translate it to him, "I extended my hands and I bought you." (Laughter) And this is the problem: "And because you belonged to them, I took my hands back and left you."" (Laughter)"
Translate it for me.
(Applause) What did we do to protect Arabic?
We turned it into a civil society, and we started a campaign to protect Arabic.
"So many people said to me, ""Why will you be worried?"
"Don't forget this understanding and make it fun for yourself."" There's no problem!"
"The sign of the campaign to protect Arabic was, "I talk to you from the East, and you're answering me from the West.""
"We didn't say, ""No! We don't accept it or it."" We didn't choose this way because they didn't understand us so."
And if someone speaks to me in that way, I hate Arabic.
We say, (Applause) We want to change our reality, and we reflect our dreams, our dreams and our everyday lives.
We're blind in a way that looks like us and we think like us.
"So there was a sign where, ""I talk to you from East, but you respond to me from Western.""
It's very simple, at the same time, creative and credible.
And then we started another campaign that was written in the box.
"You didn't see this example on the sky, on the surface of a white and yellow background, ""Don't kill your language!""
Why? Don't really kill your language.
We must not kill our language from the birth.
If we had to kill our language, we had to find our identity.
We had to find our existence.
We had to come back at the beginning.
It's also a serious question of losing our chance to be modern and cultural.
And then, we spread the images of men and girls that were broken by Arabic cultures.
"""Cool"" pictures of girls and boys."
"We're very cool!"
"And anyone says, ""Oh, you've worked English!"" I say, ""No! I've not understood the word cool."" So, if they believe, let me say, but give me a beautiful word that gives me a better expression of reality."
"I'll continue to say ""the Internet."" I don't say, ""I'm going to the world's mirror tower."" (Laughter) Because it doesn't matter! We shouldn't miss ourselves."
But as we come to this point, we have to believe that if it's a problem, we should not allow those who think that's bigger or we think there's a nuclei on our face to control us or think and feel they want us.
It's an idea to be creative.
If we can't fly on the kain, or we can't build a raket, and so we can be creative.
You're all of you now a creative project.
Creativity in your native language is a way.
Let's start from that moment.
Let's take a novel or take a short movie.
One single novel can make us global again.
This Arabic can lead you to become a number again.
"So, it's not right to say, ""There's no way to come up."" There's a way to fall!"
But we have to know and believe that there's a way to come up, and we have to be part of the way to come up.
Just as a result, what can you do today?
The screws, who vibrating?
If my time ends, I want you to be more than Arabic, English, French or Chinese.
But when you write Arabic, don't write numbers with Latin graphics.
(Applause) This is a disaster! It's not a language!
You're going to introduce the virtual world with virtual language.
It's not easy to fly back from such a country.
This is the first thing we can do.
Secondly, there are many other things we can do.
We haven't collapsed here today to believe each other.
We're here to focus on the importance of protecting this language.
Now, I'm going to open a secret to you.
The body knows his father for the first time through language.
"When my daughter was born, I'm going to say to him, ""This is your father, love. (Laughter)" I won't say to him in English, ""This is your dad, honey."" And my daughter Nura says that in the supermarket he says to me Arabic, ""Thank you."" I say to him, ""Mary, Mom," I won't want to do and I don't hope that nobody heard him."
(Applause) So let's take us out of adapting ourselves to this civilization. (Applause)
I learned a few things when I did these 30-day tests.
For a test, I took a picture every day for a month.
I'm 30 days before I started a test.
He's very bad.
They're really fun.
(Applause)
As I read the school well, it was high expectancy, and I started my life with a student full of passion, travel and journey.
Now, I felt very miserable, confident, scared of people involved, of failure in the future, and the space I felt in.
"I heard a strange pain voice when I left the room, like this, when I was bleeding like that I had done, and I was listening to it, and when I left the room, I felt, ""She's leaving the room."" I grew up at the stage."
There was no one in my side, and the clarity and precision of the face I heard was uncertain.
"""He opens the door."" I heard."
It was a beginning. It came.
And in the first days, and then in weeks, everything I did was talking to me with the third person in the desert.
"He goes to the engineer."
And I also thought that the pain was a very neutral voice, a pain, and even a while later, she was a friend and hopeful voice, and that it would be a way that I'm not going to express the emotions that I didn't have over time.
For example, when I was the source, I was often hiding my heart and my real particles, the voice came to me.
And this was what happened: the ordinary people didn't hear sounds, and it was a serious position of listening to me.
The pain I've taken to my college.
I needed this right, interest and help, and I started talking to him about my amazing commentator.
"For example, I worked as a researcher of university news in the student TV, and I had to go to the doctor at the time to stay on the night, ""I want to go."
And then, the situation started to get out of my surveillance very quickly.
I was asleep in the hospital, and then the schizophrenia bleeding, and then the worst thing: an unpredictable unconsciousness, shame and suffering about myself and my future.
The voice I heard was not a simple life experience, but because I was convinced that it was a symmetry, it started to increase my fear and anxiety.
It was an aggressive battle against this mind, a kind of mental battle, which started to increase the number of sounds, to become more hostile and hateful voices.
Do you see a cockroach that's water inside?
Soon, it was a period of fear, of escape, of uncertainty and of disagreement, and I was not in the perspective of creating peace and peace in this battle that I felt vulnerable.
Two years later, my life started to be worse.
I already had all the courage of the girl: terrible sounds, bizarre images, strange, unintended calculations.
Now, when I look at the darkness and the uncertainty of those years, I think a man is dead, a man is saved.
A limited person and a rocked person was sent to the surface, and he wanted to go back from that journey, and eventually I had to go back to someone I had to get involved.
Over my life, many people hurt me, and they all remember, but these moments were very weak and weak compared to people who helped me.
I believe Eleanor can do this.
"And he said, "If sometimes it rains in the moon, it's certainly going to spread."" And in 14 minutes, it doesn't matter to thank those beautiful people who are fighting with me and for me, waiting for me to get back from it and out of the desert, and waiting for me to be able to be able to thanked."
Of course, it was hard to believe that the voices had come back to the enemy and the accelerator, so the first important step was that I didn't learn to understand my real calculations before.
For example, I've learned to describe the voices that cross me with those who would attack my house — not as a real and ordinary threat, but as a fear and a threat that I felt.
And sometimes I believed them.
One night, I remember even sitting in the door of my parents and taking their boxes to protect them from the sounds I actually calculate.
"You can say, ""Don't work with me."
"I said, ""Do you don't have plastic clothes?"" That's my strategy."
After I realized that, unfortunately, I've come back to psychiatry in a completely different role, by getting out of particles in the front of it.
Now, I'm proud of being a member of the organization of Intervoice's International Sex Association, and this goal, which goes through the work of Mr. Mario Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher, is taking voices into a strategy of life, thinking and understanding, not as a source of schizophrenia, but as a difficult, important and meaningful thing to learn.
This kind of society is possible, even building it already.
Now, there's a French statement that if the social change starts, there's no return.
It's not going to push the poor.
It's impossible to press people who are not afraid anymore.
In the last 20 years, we've never spread the Earth in five continents and 26 countries, and working together, it's expanding the opportunities of people who have compassion, compassion and spiritual difficulty, and becoming hopeful followers and provedors.
As Peter Levine said, it's a unique creature that has an intellectual spirit to use this ability that has human relief instinct.
In this regard, the greatest honor for our community is to help help help someone who needs help, to stay together, to extend the hand, to share the suffering and to apologize.
We're not like. We're not free.
You can't always take or pick out of us what we're doing.
The light doesn't shine forever.
"As one of my head once said to me, ""Don't tell others what they said at your bar."
"So talk about yourself."" Thank you very much."
(Applause)
I'm here to talk about my photograph.
But is this a photo?
Because, of course, it's not a photo you can take with your camera.
And again, my mom of photography started when I bought my first photo at 15 years.
I put it together with my favorite of the previous art, but in a little different way, because when I use the camera, I planned a kind of process before.
When you take a photo with the camera, the work is ready to print the button of the camera.
For me, photography wasn't just made of being right at the right time.
I thought everyone could do this.
So I wanted to create something different, something that started to happen after the 1930s photographed.
So pictures like this: that's the key to work on a path.
But it became an unpredictable game.
And despite that, it looks pretty close.
Or pictures like this — both dark and colored, but they all have to protect a certain degree of realization.
I'm looking for photo-reality when I'm a realization.
Because, of course, these are not really pictures that we can take, but I'd like to have visible images that can be taken with some camera.
I'd like to have some pictures that you're going to think about to understand the future.
So it's really about keeping a better idea than keeping a moment.
Well, what's the place that gives him the true appearance?
Does it relate to these details or colors?
Does it relate to light?
What's the creation of illusion?
Sometimes it's a perspective of creating illusion.
But then, how to understand the world is that it's based on how to do this on the surface of two-dimensional (2D).
It's not what this reality really is, it's what the real things that seem to us.
So the basic idea is very simple.
I see this when I put real works into one place and make a real inventor that I've created a alternative reality.
I'm going to show you a simple example.
There are three numbers of physical objects that can be perfect imagined, three-dimensional things that relate to our world.
But when it's unified in a certain way, it looks like a three-dimensional object that still exists.
We also know that it can't exist.
So we play games with our brains because our brains can't accept that it's not the meaning of reality.
And I also see the same process when I combine pictures.
It's actually about combining different realities.
So, a picture is things that show real things, things that we don't think about, things that are around us in our everyday lives.
And when you combine images, it's really important to look at it, because it seems wrong at the other hand.
What I want to say is there are three simple sources that we have to do to get a real result.
As you see, there's no particular part of these pictures.
But when it's unified, it takes something like this.
So in the first source, the perspective of the unified pictures should be the same.
Secondly, the same should be the light of the unified images.
And in these two ways, these two conditions were expected — the same height and the same light.
Thirdly, it's impossible to describe the picture, see where one of the shape ends and separate the other from where it starts.
It must be unified in a way that can't be separated from how the shape is created.
We remove the boundaries between different images, using the size, contrast and light, using the depth of the field, using the effects like the left color and the light, and providing it to look like a single image, although there are hundreds of details like this.
And that's another example.
(Laughter) People can think that's a domain official and that's the bottom of the altered box.
But in fact, this picture was completely made of a combination of pictures of different places.
I think it's easier to create a place, rather than find a place, and you don't have to change your ideas so little.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And I knew that this idea was a few months from the winter of understanding to find different places for planning and fundamentally completing the parts of the inventor.
For example, the fish was taken when the official fish was caught.
And the mountains are different places.
Six pieces of water were taken in a stone bag.
And yes, even the house on the surface of the island was red to look more Swedish way.
So it's possible to make a real result, I think it's possible in terms of planning.
It always starts with a collision, with a idea.
And then we can combine different pictures.
For example, every piece was very well planned.
And if you draw pictures well, the result can be very beautiful and also quite realistic.
So we have all the tools we need, and the only thing that limits us is our imagination power.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Juliet, you're happy.
So there's a data that Wikileaks has published more information than all the world's press published in the last few years.
Is that possible?
Julian Assange: Well, can it be true?
Isn't it worrying that the rest of the world's media work so bad? Is a small group of activists able to spread more information than all the world's press?
CA: How do you do this?
How do people spread these papers?
How does the principle of self protect?
CA: So, as we know, these are people who disseminate data, and there are different ways to get these data to us.
We call a national court, like Sweden and Belgium, to prevent surveillance, to encrypt information to easily disseminate on the Internet, to protect the law.
And it's encrypted or easy to accept that it's encrypted, it's analyzing, formating, forming — it's a little bit difficult when it's a big database — it's open to the community and protect ourselves against the possible legal and political attacks.
CA: So it means that the copyright of the document is available. You don't know who the source of information is very often.
CA: It's true. We know them very rarely. If we find the source of information, we immediately destroy that information.
(Applause) It's cool.
(Laughter) CA: I think it's CIA, it's a TED member's code. (Laughter)
I think we're looking at modern missions.
This is the information that was broken a few years ago.
Let's look at you.
It was a story from Kenya.
Can you talk about how to cut this story out?
CA: This is the Royal report.
After the election of 2004, Kenya was an investigation carried out by the government.
By the election of 2004, Kenya was underwent for 18 years by the Arab Joe.
He was a real dictator in Kenya.
When the power of the coalization came to the government and began to fight against corruption, they published this joint report by spending two million pounds.
The government also used this report as a political force against Moya, who was the richest man in Kenya at that time and now.
It's like the holy book of Kenyan journalism.
In 2007 I went to Kenya a little bit before the 28th December election, and I could get papers.
We published this report three days after the new president Kyabi, Danny Arab Moyn, who started to come up to the money of the Arab Moin, and the report was devastated by the president Kubai.
CA: Long words — the report was not direct to the Kenyan press, it's all over the way, and you think that it changed the result of the election.
CA: Yes. The news was published on the Guardian's head page, and then in countries around Kenya, Tanzania and Canada in Africa.
The news came outside.
And in a few days, the Kenyan press began to easily write about that.
20 days later, it was published in the Kenyan press, and according to the report of the Kenyan security service, it changed 10 percent of the voices, which led to change the results of the election.
CA: So the information you've broken has really changed the world?
CA: Yeah.
(Applause) CA: And this time, there's a video about the weather cell in Baghdad.
The video is a bit long. It's a short clip shape.
First of all, there's a little violence in this video.
Radio: ... If you're blind, you're just opening them up.
Now they look at Xamar.
It's cool. The father.
All you see. Thank you.
Shoot all.
Father, fire!
(Automatic weapon fire) Take it, continue. (Automatic weapon fire) So.
Hotel: Bushmaster Two-Six, Bushmaster Two-Six.
You have to come back now!
We've killed all eight people.
We have two vertolytes, and we're going to fire.
He was. They all died.
Two-Six, two-Six, we're acting.
Oops. Thank you. What was it?
Zibil, Kyle. Ahaa, it's a solution, yeah.
CA: What's the impact of this video?
CA: It's hard for people who are good at this.
To study this video, two people were sent in Baku.
It's actually one of three attacks in the video.
CA: If I don't do this, 11 people died at this attack, including two Reuters's employees, right?
CA: Yes. Two Reuters workers died, two children ran.
In total, 18 to 26 people died.
CA: The publication of these things caused a huge collision.
What do you think of the main reason for this anger and collision?
CA: I don't know exactly, I think people see the inequality of power.
The Apocalypse vertolyot that flew on the coral calmly moving people flew with a 30mm-dimensional coral — and without any reason — they kill even those who saved the blessings.
There were also two reporters who were accurate who were not prosecutors and who did their own work.
CA: The US security officer, Bradley Manning, was arrested, and he said, in his interview room, with video, he admitted that 280,000 US embassy wrote to you.
Is this true?
CA: We rejected those books.
Five days ago, 150,000 years ago, before writing, 50 years ago, they were arrested.
We published the official records of the U.S. embassy in Reykjavik before this year, but they don't have to work.
I traveled to that embassy.
CA: If you had received the diplomatic records of the U.S. embassy?
CA: We published them. (CA: Did you do this? CA: Yeah. CA: Why? CA: CA: CA: The fact that the country has actually found human rights positions in Arabian countries, like this: China.
If you open the secret document, there's a type of material.
CA: So let's talk about it a little bit more detail.
In general, what kind of ideology do you stand?
Why do you correct calculate the publication of a hidden document?
CA: So there's a question about what information is important for the world, what information can lead to reconstruction.
In fact, there's a lot of changes.
The idea that the economic power that institutions use to hide is that there will be new and good things to produce those news, and that institutions with these data can also know how to hide their data.
It's always like this. The history of journalism depends on it.
CA: But it's not a little dangerous thing, but when it's a failure, it can be a bad result for people, even for the whole society, because it doesn't matter you.
CA: There's still no case in the data that we've spread.
So we have a policy to protect damage.
There are some personal information that we communicate with them and then publish them.
There are also blood acids — such as medical advice, such acids are preserved by law, but we work with news carriers who really know what they do.
CA: So everyone knows their work better.
"If someone who's a son service in the U.S. office came to you and said, ""You know you've published a video that someone wants to spread for any purpose?"
The American army shows people laugh when they die.
It shows millions of people in this world that American soldiers don't have human particles. It's not true.
"My son isn't that. What kind of courage do you do this motion?"" What would you answer?"
CA: So there's a lot of things.
But remember that people in Baghdad, Iraq, Afghanistan don't need to see this video; they see it every day.
They don't change their minds. They don't change their minds, they don't change parts.
They see these fears every day.
It's going to change the relationship of people who pay money for this war. That's what we're doing.
CA: So you don't find a way to reveal the secret secrets of government and companies.
Lighting is good.
But the strange thing is that you have to hide your own sources to light the secrets.
CA: It's not exactly that. There's still no people who are confronted with Wikipedia.
Or we don't have any data rather than any sources.
If there's a lot of things, it might be hard for us. We work so that people who work with us are trying to help us continue their work if they're losing us.
CA: So what's interesting for me when I heard — what do TEDsters think about that?
There are two kinds of ideas about WikiLeaks and Juliet.
One — a hero who illuminates the relativity.
It's a dangerous journey.
Who thinks it's strange?
So do you look dangerous?
CA: Well, there's a couple of people.
CA: These were my poor people, Juliet.
We have to try a little more. Let's show another example.
I think it's not published yet, but it's going to be published at TED.
It's a interesting fact that happened recently, right?
What's this document?
CA: It's an example of what we see every day.
Last year — November — in Albania, there were explosions like the Gulf of Mexico, even if it wasn't strong as the Gulf.
We received an engineering report that actually, the explosion was done by the way the protectors of the digital companies landed charges.
And the government of Albania and other people were right here.
But the technical report didn't have any relationship with them. It was a little hard document.
We didn't know who wrote and what it was about.
We were a little doubt that the dance oil company could also be a game.
"So we looked at the document, and we said, ""We're a little doubt."
We don't know what to do.
"It's good. It looks right, but we can't confirm."" We've just answered the company who wanted to find the source of information and wrote this text a week ago — (Laughter) So he said, ""We want to find the source of information."" We said, ""Don't give some information."
What document do you speak in general?
Do you belong as a law?
"You're really?"" They said, "They sent a picture of the owner of the document together to remove Microsoft Word ID on the screen."
That's how it would cut.
(Applause) So there's a lot of things.
One of the ways to determine the source of material is one of the methods that encourage writing a letter.
CA: Do you have some information about the BP?
CA: Yes, and so much, but we're now working on funding for the website, and engineers come out of their hands.
We've reduced the news that we've been published because we've tried to redefine the basis of the website in the last few months to protect our social interests.
This is a little problem.
As the other institutions that start in new activity, we're also confronted with the problems that we're going to raise from one, and we don't have enough employees to transmit and publish all of these data, even though we're actually given a lot of information.
CA: So what do you say is the money that you need to pay to senior freelance journals and/and senior journals?
CA: Yes. People we're going to believe.
And it's hard to develop the data that we have in our hands in a little bit different way, and we need people who can do this with high-level security problems now.
CA: So can you tell you why it starts?
I mean, I didn't have read that you had 37 schools at your childhood.
Is this true information?
CA: My parents were in a movie business, and I didn't run from religious meetings, which was the result of both.
(Laughter) CA: Psixologists thought that was a paradox.
CA: Are you looking for film business?
(Laughter) (Applause) CA: Because I know, when you were young, you were also a hacker, you had a problem with interviews.
CA: I was just a journalist.
I was one of the young reporters as an activist.
I was arrested as a journalist I published when I was young.
You have to be a little careful with hackers.
It's possible to do different things by the way of gravity.
Unfortunately, most of the Indian hackers are engaged to steal money on the bank account of our grandmother for Russian mafies.
The Xarkers's sales isn't like before now.
CA: I don't think you've been trying to steal someone's money. What's the main values?
Can you give short information about them, or can you talk about why they're created or about events?
CA: And I think there's no event.
But my basic values: I think people who are talented and courageous don't produce victims; they help victims.
And that's what I learned from people who were courageous as my father and father in my life.
CA: Don't it make human victims — protects them?
CA: I'm a little prosecutors, I'm not fully protecting them, I'm not showing them out, but I'm protecting the victims by detecting people from crime.
And this is my character that I have for a long time.
CA: Can you talk about what's happening in Iceland in a few minutes?
The fact that you published there was a problem with the bank, and the news agent that kept the data was also prosecuted.
Instead, the website was arrested.
You made a good imagery in Iceland. What happened then?
CA: This was a big thing.
Iceland was a economic crisis.
It was one of the biggest fractures in the world.
The Global Trade in the banking sector was over 10 times from the other areas.
We published this information in July last year.
"In fact, five years before the money was released on TV, we were sent to the television trial, like in the movies, five years ago, it started and the audience didn't know what to do, "What's happening. What should we do now?""
We published news instead of television on the web, and we were very busy in Iceland, even going here and talking about it.
In the community, everyone believed that this would happen again, and almost after we met a few Icelandic politicians and international experts, there was a new legislation that will protect the government of Iceland, which is one of the most basic laws in the world that serve journalists to protect, equal to Nobel Holocaust for its freedom.
Iceland could be included in the system of other skandinavi countries like Norway.
And just a month ago, this law was secretly accepted in the Icelandic parlament.
CA: Wowu
(Applause) So let's look forward, Juliet.
How do you believe that you're going to come? Is it going to control everything secretly, or will people like to control the Big Bang or something else?
CA: I'm not completely sure what it will happen.
All over the world — from the U.S., from China to the U.S., there are increasing terms of freedom of speech and copyright.
It's hard to see how it's going to come.
The time that we live is very interesting, and we can change everything in a very curious way.
CA: I think I feel what our audience want to mean, Juliet, be careful, be strong with you.
CA: Thank you very much, Chris. (CA: Thank you.) (Applause)
I'm a writer.
I'm my job to tell a story and write a novel, and I want to tell you a little about the story industry today, and I'm going to tell you a little about what's called the cince, and what's true.
But let me talk a little bit about my personal story before you start it.
Of course, I'm going to use words, and you're going to find a couple of places when you hear me.
I was born in Sri Lanka, in a Turkish family.
A little bit after that, my parents get married, and I come to Turkey like my mom.
At that time, I grew up as a single child in my mother's poem.
In the 1970s, the situation in Angola was a little strange.
Most of our families were large families, which were the father's family chairman, and I grew up with my mother who was the only married woman in the patriotical environment.
In fact, I grew up around two groups of women.
On the other hand, it was my mother, a young, global, modern, European Turkish woman.
On the other hand, the rest of my attention, the more faithful, less rationalized, less rationalized.
My mother looked at the coral on the coral, and he looked at the coral in a different way to remove the face of the devil.
And the people who were deep in their hands, the people who were poor in their hands, went to visit the grandmother.
Every time, my grandmother would put something in Arabic, pulls as much gold particles as much of the damage to getting red on her hand.
And then, each other was surrounded by gravity.
A week later, he came to his brain's brain.
I know that it might be strange to talk about it in front of a scientist and a scientist, but I didn't see that anyone who came back to my grandmother's cure of different dragonflies was accidentally or disappeared.
I asked what he did from my grandmother. That was the power of the house?
"He said, ""Because there's a good gift, but the power of the basic things."" And there's a lot of lessons that I learned from him, if you want to do something in your life, whether you want to be a prostitute, or the soul of the human, you need to go through the wall."
It's built and kept inside.
We all are in social and cultural areas now.
We're all inside her.
We're all born in a kind of family, in a kind of village, in a sense.
But when we can't communicate with the outside of the world, when we're far away, we're confronted with the risk of building out of the world.
We can reduce our ability, our heart is suspended, and we can lose our sense of humanity when we're staying very long in the environment.
If our friends, our neighbors, our collaborators, our family, and if we look very much, it means that we are mostly surrounded by ourselves.
In Turkey, women like mimic do something like this, they cover the eyes with particles of shape, or they turn the face of the mirror into the wall.
It's beyond the belief that there is, and it's not easy to look at his image for a long time.
Unfortunately, it's one of the biggest dangers in our globalized world to live in images that share views.
And it's happening everywhere, between liberals and gentlemen, agnostic and faithful, rich and poor, in East and West.
We form groups based on fluctuations and similarities, and we create stereotypes about others.
I don't think, writing industry could be the key way to cross these cultural gettons.
Even if stories can't split the boundaries, there can be fluctuations on the surface of our minds.
We can even like to see the other worlds, looking at these equations.
When I was eight, I started writing stories.
One day, my mom gave me a flower in color and said that I would have a good idea to write my personal stories here.
Now, I think it was a little fear of my mental interpretation at that time.
I didn't share my stories with my family at home, but it wasn't good to tell my dream friends.
So I was a kid who was in front of my door to talk to a lot of dragonflies, and so I thought my mother was a good idea to write my everyday surprises.
But he didn't know that I thought that my life was really hard, and what I wanted to do was to write about this uninteresting life.
Instead, I started writing not about myself, but about others and things that don't.
So this is how I started writing that would become my life love.
Before writing for me was more people's life, more stories for others than the autobiography manifest.
(Laughter) And I'm going to explain these things that happen in my life.
And there's another thing happening in the border of this area.
My mother became a diplomat.
And at the same time, I went out of this small, amateur, medium-sized environment, and I landed into a international school environment in Madrid, and I was the only Turk at school.
"For the first time, I was in a difficult environment that I expressed as ""typical external,"" in Sinif, there were children from all nations, but it created an engineering of evolutionary democracy that won't be seen by cosmopolis, not by class."
In fact, in this museum, children were considered to represent their personalities, not themselves, but a bigger nation.
We looked like the U.S., and it was fun, except talking about a bad event for any nation.
So the child became a source of malaria, it was always incidental.
And I remember very well that when I arrived at this school, Turkey became a military movement, a Turkish armed band tried to kill Papan, and in the Eurasian music conference, Turkey took zero numbers.
(Laughter) At that time, I often wanted to run from school and be a marine.
So, for the first time, I saw a cultural stereotype concept in this school.
"And all the kids asked me about ""Midnight Express,"" and they asked me how many cigarettes I smoke per day, because they drank all kinds of cigarettes, and when they started, they asked me to hide my head."
I learned three strereotips about Turkey here, these are: politics, cigarette and headquarters.
After Spain, we returned to Ireland, Germany and back to Angola.
And I thought that my passion and my imagination were the only journey bag that I could carry with myself, all of these trips.
Stories gave me a sense of unification, continuity and perseverance — that's what I was vulnerable to these particles in real life.
When I was 20 years old, I moved to a city in Baku, which I loved very much.
I lived in a very cosmopolistic and living environment, and I wrote some of my novel here.
I was there when I was born in Estonia in 1999.
The scene that I saw when I rushed out of the building on the 3th morning stopped me.
He had an old, old seller, who didn't sell alcohol in the store, he didn't talk to people outside and living marginaal lives.
In his head, a long black pair was sitting on the front of a transsexual, which spread on his eyes.
And I saw that she gave him a cigarette offering him from the cigarette that she's chewing gum's hand, and that's the rest of the scene that I think of that night was — to smoke outside the way of a transsexual that was crying with a protector.
When we're confronted with death and explosions, our global differences disappear, but we're all one, even for a few hours.
And I've always believed that stories have a visual effect.
I don't want to say that nature is strong as a genius, but when you read a good novel, it's far away from our little comfortable room, we start to recognize people we never found in the dark of the night and sometimes we don't have a good idea.
Soon after that, I went to Boston and then to the girls college in Michigan.
It's not only geological, but it's a complete change from my view of language.
I started writing English.
It's war, I can't travel, and I can't travel. They ask why I'm writing in English, and it helps me change my writing language.
I love writing in Turkish, and I think I'm more poetic and emotionally, and I love writing in English, and I think it's more mathematical and intuitive.
I think I'm connected to every language differently.
As millions of people in the world, I learned English later.
When you learn any language later, you have to lose what they've learned.
As language comes later, we want to speak more, to work better words, to make better conversations, we speak less, because there's a huge difference between our brains and our language.
This difference is scary.
But if we learn not to be afraid of him, it can stimulate us.
And that was what I learned in Boston — it was a glimpse and a flute stimulus that I lived.
At that time, all my activities follow all of my days, all of my day-and-to-day prayers include me to marry, and I could just put together after he died.
Because God loved my grandmother, I created my family life.
(Laughter) But instead of deciding, I went to Arizona.
And because my wife was in Istanbul, I started to go and go between Arizona, in Baku, and I couldn't feel so much different at the other two points of the world.
My part is always moving, physically and spiritually.
Like all my memories and parts are always with me to keep my stories.
And I think it's going to lose his magic when it's more really connected to the story than the story.
I'd like to think about this with you.
One of the things I wrote in English, when I saw light face in America, one of the public critics said that.
"I liked the book."" He said, "But you would write a little different piece.""
(Laughter) So I asked what he meant.
"And he said, ""And if we look at you, we're going to see that many Spanish, American, American, Spanish heroes, but there's only a Turk who's a man."" Actually, he's actually busy in Boston at university camp, because it's normal for me to have heroes than many other nations, but I understand what the critter wants to say."
But I know that I'm going to continue to animate him.
He always wanted to be my personal manifest.
He wanted to be a Turkish woman in the book because I was a Turkish woman.
We're always talking about changing the world of stories, and we can also see that politics influenced the spread, the lecture and the understanding of ideas.
Most writers, especially not westers, are suffering from this pressure.
If you're a woman from the Islamic world like me, they're waiting to write about the Islamic woman, it's better if this Muslim woman isn't happy.
They expect you to write more informative, bold, typical stories, get away from the west perspective.
When I was a kid, in Madrid, the prboles that I was confronted have also been available in India's world literature.
Writingers look like not as creative people with personal ideas, but as representatives of culture and countries, some writers from China, some of Turkey from Nigeria.
They're waiting to be able to adapt our diversity, not to our diversity.
In 1982, when they took a interview from a writer and a researcher James Baldw, they asked him a couple of times about homosexuality.
"The person who took it, when he tried to appreciate him as a blue writer, Baldwin stopped, and he said, ""You don't see that I have anything else that doesn't have anything else?"" And that's the same as what I have in everything."" When we marked politics, it means that our freedom is under the danger."
There's an unimaginable catastrophe called multitasking literature, which is all the writers who are not from the west.
About 10 years ago, I remember the first multitasking lecture at Harvard.
We were three writers, a person from Philippines, a man from Turkey, and one from Indonesia to a doctor.
(Laughter) If we brought us together, we didn't have a legal or a legal obligation.
It was only our passports.
The writers from another nation are waiting to write real stories.
There's a function in reality.
In this way, not only writers, but their characters are also a member of a bigger mass.
I have to realize that this approach to history doesn't exist only in the West.
That's how in the world is.
I saw this for the first time when I was arrested in 2005, because of the story of the ancient history.
I tried to write a constructive, multi-dimensional work about Turkey and Turkey's family with women's eyes.
When I was brought to the court, my little story became a big macro problem.
Because I wrote about Turkey- Armenia conflict, some were prosecuted, some were prosecuted.
But at that moment, I'd like to say to both sides, that's just literature.
It's just a story.
"I don't want to reduce the value of the work I've seen when I said ""Just a story.""
I love and support it because it's not because it's understood, but because it's how it's.
Writingers are recognized by their view of the string, but political books are enough today, and literature is not the language of everyday politics.
"Sexov said, ""The right way to solve the matter and the correct way to put it is completely different concepts."
"And the second is the work of a artist."" The politics separates us from each other. The reality unites us."
Some include interactions.
It's a great difference.
Some take the border.
The street doesn't know the boundaries.
politics was made of a strong coral.
Nature is water.
"In the Osman period, there were people who said a satellite story called ""mobbing," and they went to the cafeteria, and they told stories that they were very embarrassed before the audience."
They changed their voices to express the different images in the story, they've broken them.
Everyone went to listen to him, beautiful people, even kingdom, Muslims, non-Muslims.
"The equals crossed the boundaries, like Middle Asia, North Africa, Balkans and Asia, the Naft of the Middle World."
Stories continue to cross the boundaries today.
When Palestinian and Israeli politicians speak, they don't listen to each other, but the work of a Palestinian writer is reading the work of a Palestinian writer and communicating with the story.
Nature needs to bring us closer.
If you don't do it, it's not a good work.
Books saved me — a kind of kind of shameful and shameful kid.
But there's also a threat to disconnected books.
After the writer and the lawyer Rumi encounter his spiritual friend with the Sams Library, the first thing of Shamen was to love the destruction of those who were written in the water of Rumi's books.
"So we say, ""The knowledge that doesn't get you away is more than ignorance."" The problem of today's cultural gettos is not lack of ignorance and knowledge, we think we know more about each other, we know more true, we don't get away from ourselves, we're elite, we're distant from others and we're losing our relationship."
I love a pattern: living as a comet's motion.
One of the characters of the kompass is stable.
And the other thing is that it's growing up, it's rotating.
And that's my works.
One of the things I wrote is that Iceland has moved to Turkey, and another part is moving around the world, connecting between different cultures.
In this regard, my work considers both local and universal, and I believe that it's relevant at all here and here.
You're probably seeing the Chapel House, which was the west of the Armenian soldats for 1400 years.
In the House, there's a place called the Point of Meetings of the Cines, outside the room of the sea.
That's the place between the buildings.
I like this approach very much.
We usually don't believe the regions between something.
We calculate these places as a source of gravity, which is made of a fireless fire, which is symbolized as a symbol of variation.
And I think the country in the background must be the artist's place.
I prefer variation and multitasking as I write.
I love not to think about 10 pages later.
I love my heroes surprise me.
In one of my novel, I can tell you about a Muslim woman, and maybe it's a very happy woman, and my other book can be a bright blue professor from Norway.
As long as we come from inside, we can discover everything.
"Audo Lorde says, ""Our smart fathers say, ""I think I can say, ""Well, he says, ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry."" I think it was a good example."
And I don't understand why when we learn writing, we're talking about things you know for students.
Maybe it's not very good for it to start.
Creativity doesn't matter what we're, what we know and how we have personality.
We have to teach young people and each other to write about what we feel with open heart.
We have to take away from the cultural gettons, we have to recognize the other worlds.
It's sort of drawing things like dragonflies, dragonflies, dragonflies.
Not depending on the political situation, they're all unified, and that's a good news.
"I wanted to end my dream with an old river, ""Let's meet, be friends, put things on the road; love; the world is a fan of love."" Thank you very much."
(Applause)
My big idea is a little idea that will reveal millions of big ideas inside us.
I'm going to sleep this little idea.
(Laughter) (Applause) Here's a group of women.
They're women.
I also realized the value of the sleep very hard.
Two and a half years ago, I lost my dream of tiredness.
My head was sitting on the table, my face bleeding, my right eye was hit five screws.
I started to understand the value of the dog at this time.
In that moment, I was looking at, talking to doctors and scientists, so I could say that the only way to become more productive is to sleep normal.
(Applause) In this way we're going to start with women.
We're going to be the most living in the real sense of the word.
(Laughter) (Applause) Because unfortunately, sleep is calculated as igidity for men.
In the near time, when he sat with a man, he started talking about she slept four hours in the first night.
"And I said, ""Well, I didn't say — ""You know.""
"If you had five hours of sleep, would India have been more interesting?"" (Laughter) Most men sleep less."
"So here, in Washington, you want to invite someone to eat tomorrow, and you ask, ""What's the eight?"" And it's probably eight too late, but there's nothing, it's a little tennis, and then I'll call you a few places."" They think they're really busy and productive, but I think they're not so, because it's now enough leaders in economic, political and commercial decisions."
You have a high IQ.
Not being a good leader, but being a good leader is to see the asteroid before it hits Titan.
There's enough insects that make our Titanics.
I think Lehman Brothers would still be grateful if they had Lehman Brothers and sisters.
(Applause) When the girls worked for 7 days 24 hours, the girls who sleeped for 7 hours and half or eight hours could see the brain, maybe they could understand why it would happen.
In a period that we're confronted with a lot of fractures, it's the best thing that's useful for ourselves, that's useful for ourselves, that's happiness, that's effective for the whole world.
And again, I'm going to be able to see the big ideas in our minds, to remove your eyes, the devices, to discover the power of your sleep.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I was like a kid with a woman's body.
If you see the brain, the brain is made of two separate paralyzedies.
Sorry for a minute. Thank you very much. It was fun.
The past information about energy has spread across all the sensational systems at the same time, and tells us how the moment looks like, how it smells, how it's feeling and how it sounds.
We're an energy that's connected to the energy around us through our right hemisphere.
At this point, we're perfect, full and blind.
And the left hemisphere is a completely different place.
The left hemisphere thinks methodically.
And our left hemisphere thinks in any language.
The only thing I could do was external energy — power.
"And I said to myself, ""What do you see me?"
I feel light in my body. Thank you.
