(Arabic) I'm looking for a monastery from Satan in Alah, called Alah, a milestrian and a milestrian.
I was born in a middle class family.
That's why I was so lucky.
My mother was born 16 children.
From 16 children, only five were alive.
Imagine what my childhood was.
Every day, I saw women who were in love or children who went to visit the gallons.
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children.
Unfortunately, there was no Internet for girls in my country, so I was accepted in the middle school, but I couldn't visit him.
And my father sent me to America.
I moved to America.
I finished my education.
When I studied, Russian soldiers entered my country.
You know, when I graduated from university, I didn't even know what happened to my family and to my country.
There were months, years, but I didn't know anything.
My family was in the refugee camp.
When I finished my study, I moved my family to America.
I wanted them to live in safety.
Where was my heart?
My heart was in Afghanistan.
I had a good job.
I studied at university.
And here I went to the refugee camp.
When I came to this camp in Pakistan, I saw 7.5 million refugees, and I saw 7.5 million refugees.
About 90 percent of them were women and children. Most men were killed or killed. You know when I was in the refugee camp.
When I conducted a survey every day, I found things you can't imagine.
I saw a show with five to eight children sitting and crying, and she didn't know what to do.
I saw a young woman who couldn't go anywhere, had no education, no entertainment that had even a place for life.
It was a very abusive situation.
At that moment, we talk about momentum.
At that time, I asked myself, "What can I do for those people?"
How can I help them?
At that time, I realized that education changed my life.
She changed me, she gave me status.
At that time, I realized that I had to give my people education and health, and I started working on it.
Do you think I was easy?
Not because at that time, education was completely banned by girls.
"It was hard to come and say, ""I want to do that."" Who am I?"
Did they trust me? Of course not.
That's why I had to put trust in this community.
How did I intend to do that?
I conducted a survey and I was looking, I was looking.
I asked.
He was 80 years old.
He was brave.
"And he looked at me, and he said, ""Well, a girl who is a girl who is a girl, how can I be a teacher?"" And I said to him, ""I'm going to do a teacher from you."" Finally, he agreed, and when I started talking to him, the news began to spread."
Almost a year later, we had 25 schools, and 15,000 children who were going to these schools, and it was amazing.
Of course, we're working, we're teaching teachers, we're teaching women's rights, human rights, the principles of democracy, the rules, and we're doing diverse training. One day, I'll tell you.
One day, I was in the office in Peshawar, Pakistan.
"And I've often seen my employees walking to the room, open the door and say, ""Look, go!"" If you're the leader you do?"
You're angry. You know that it's dangerous.
You know that your life is on the cost.
But as a leader, you have to be brave.
You have to marry and show power.
So I invited them to myself.
They came. Nine talents.
I invited them to sit and offer tea.
They refused, they said they wouldn't drink tea.
Of course, their tone, the voice they talked to me, really fell in love with me.
But I was strong, and I kept strong.
"They said, ""What are you doing?"
My employees started to go to the office.
They continued to open the clicks.
They worked with my mother and children.
We've conducted training about women's health.
We've conducted all the training you can only imagine.
I was happy. I was fascinated by the results of my work.
One day, four coaches, one gardener, and I went north from Columbus, and again, suddenly we stopped the middle of the journey of 19 young men.
With the twins on the plaques, they put us the way.
We're going to kill everyone this time."
We know where you are going.
Everyone left home. Nobody left.
I had only a gardener. I lost my voice.
There were hundreds of women coming to get education.
So here I was sitting and unexpected — at that moment, we talk about momentum — at that moment one of my wonderful donors called the report.
"And she said, ""Can she get?"" I said to her."
Today, these people are my best coaches.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
This shows that education changes people.
I live in a country that was beautiful and good.
I just want to share with you.
We could go wherever we wanted.
Do you know what happened to my country?
Today, people can't leave the house without paying attention to safety.
But we want to go back to our old Afghanistan.
They get diplomas, and they're going to learn on interviews.
He said that compassion and love can transform the universe.
Sirver Aliance: What do you want?
Client: GS, let's look.
Server: So you're wearing a broken patch, packaged with the best compressed data, two-coded bread, birch with surgery, Kanner's white chips, to this pollinary pollination salata, and you're printed with a code whistleblow.
Client: I'm welcome to get a battery with operational memory and drink a piece of your best chocolate.
Server: Is there something on the salts?
We have tall tall data numbers.
Clients: Let's give you a piece of strawberries if you want.
Server: It's the fastest one.
I'm going to serve your order quickly.
(Applause) My Pan: I'm drawing from your couple how I learned to keep the pencil in my hand, and I'm drawing the multiverse in native children at age three.
And then I learned who are these animators.
On the TV, they showed a program of profession that most kids don't know.
"When I realized that animators were those that they did the multiverse that I was looking at the screen, I just said, ""I want to be an animator!"" I don't know if I heard it, or myself, but it was a big decision moment of my life."
Pictures of animations and art were always my favorite affairs.
"But interest in computer technologies was born with the idea of creating an animation ""The Green Wall."" ("Malizious Dishes," which is the beginning) There was a virus on my computer, and I tried to miss it, and suddenly I thought, and what if there was a small world in the middle of the computer?"
Or maybe there's a window there where they meet to paint together?
This is the way the gold grass was born.
When I was four years old, Dad showed me how to pick up the computer into parts and put it back.
So I felt hard to computer technologies.
I built my first online website in a language of HTML, and now I'm learning JavaScript and Python.
"And I also develop a new animation called ""Applause."" And it's about bees and other pollinators that exist in the universe, and why they're useful."
If the flowers weren't plastered by these pollinators, all the things that depends on the plants would end up be dying from the voice.
So I decided to use these file creations and make them a superhero team.
(Applause) (Applause of legs) (Music) (Applause) Asking: Absolutely! Who else!
You need to call the rest of the Explorer!
(Music) Thank you. (Applause) All of my animations started with ideas, but what are these ideas?
Ideas can inspire their hands.
Ideas are the ability and the development.
Because of the ideas, the world is actually around.
If it wasn't an idea, we wouldn't be there where we are now, there would be no technical or medical invention, no art, culture, our lifestyle.
"When I was eight years old, I took my ideas and opened the company ""My Ideas,"" and alongside him the foundation ""My Ideas for the planet.""
(Laughter) I'm making eco-friendly clothes and oxytours.
I'm 13 years old, and despite the fact that I started with the factory in 2008, my art development started a lot earlier.
A huge impact on me always showed art, and I wanted to help it to everything I do, including my company.
When I came from a piece of different fabrics in the house, I thought I could make a glass or a glass — I had so many ideas of manufacturing the material!
"And I noticed that when I made my products, I stopped on the street, and I was wondering, "How beautiful. Where can I buy this?""
And I thought that I could do this and open a firm.
Because I was only eight years old, I didn't have any special business development plans.
I just knew I wanted to make beautiful things that would not have lost the environment, and I wanted to share with those who had less than I had experienced in my life.
My mother taught me how to swim, and I sat on the back of my house and made links on my head from the lines, and on the sheet I wrote the name and price for every piece of my product.
I started to create more products, such as shoes, chalk and bags.
My products started to buy around the world, and I had clients in Denmark, Italy, Australia, Canada and other countries.
And I realized that I had a lot of things to learn about how to manage things, like corporate name and distribution, how to support customer relations and observe what is selling better or worse.
The early business began to grow.
"And once I was 10 years old, I was in contact with the Forbes magazine."
(Laughter) They wanted to write about me and my company in their atlas.
Many people ask me why are my products ecological?
From a small age, I was deeply interested in the environment and in the creation that they live in.
My parents taught me how to share with those who were less vulnerable, and with mind and willing to stand up to the environment.
I learned that fabrics or even processing fabrics would produce things that are dangerous for people and planets, and I started my research and learned that even after painting there was a problem for the environment that I didn't know what to do with the rest.
With the rest of the process of coloring, or with the rest, there's the most dry color.
This contaminates the air, making it taxi for everyone and everyone who breathes them.
So when I started with the factory, I knew two things: all my products should be ecological, and that 10 to 20 percent of my income should be offered to local and global charity organizations.
(Applause) I think I'm part of a new wave of entrepreneurs who don't just want to earn money but also hope for a sustainable development of the world.
I believe I can satisfy my customers, and I'm very confident that future generations can live more eco-friendly lives.
We live in a big, diverse and beautiful world, and that's why I'm going to protect it even more.
Put what happens in the world only through your head and your mind is not enough.
Everything needs to be done through our heart, because it's then that we're creating an idea of organizing our brains.
That's the way the ability and the invention see the world, so the idea becomes real.
Thank you all for peace and happiness.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Pat Mitchell: You've ever heard my parents talking about this magic woman. Where are they?
Please Mr and Mr. Pan, maybe you ... You.
(Applause)
Here's a few images of the galaxies' connectivity.
The name is perfectly matched with reality.
They manage these huge collections of galaxies that relate to each other's collective gravity.
Most of the steps you see on the screen are not the only stars, but the collection of stars or galaxies.
Now, showing you some of these images, I hope you'll see soon that connecting galaxies are not just beautiful objects, but more than that, I think the combinations of galaxies are mysterious, they're surprised, and they're useful.
They're useful as the source of the most powerful laboratory in the universe.
And in your role as a laboratory, writing combinations means writing the experiments you can do on them.
I think there are four fundamental types, and the first type you want to inform is in the context of something very big.
Actually, how big is it?
Okay, it's an image of one concrete connectivity of galaxies.
It's so massive that the light that passes through it emerges from the extreme gravity of this unit.
And when you look very carefully, you'll be able to see the circles around the universe.
To avoid being vocal, this galaxies have a weight of over a million billion sun.
It's absolutely how massive these systems can be.
But more than that, they have an extra particularity.
They are basically isolated systems, and if you want, we can think about them as a small version of the universe.
"And on many questions that can happen in us about the global universe, like, ""How does gravity work?""
You can answer when you study these systems.
Yes, that's what we've been talking about the incredible crowd.
The second type is that things are very hot.
Yes, if you take a picture of the galaxy's connection, and you remove all the light that is released by stars, then this big, blue steep remains.
It's a unfair colour.
What we see here is actually a X-ray light.
So the question is, if it's not the galaxies that emit this light?
And the answer will be hot gas, a million degrees of gas, it's actually plasma.
And the cause of such a cold can be found on the preliminary slide.
The extreme gravity of these systems connects the particles of gas and gives them a huge speed, and the enormous speed, in its course, is a huge temperature.
That's the key point, but it's just a scientific eclipse.
There are also many other peculiarities of this plasma that while the head is still flying to us, and still reinforced our understanding of the physics of the superpowers.
The third is a very small study.
To tell you about it, I need to tell you about a worrying fact.
Most of the mathematics of the universe are not made of atoms.
You have been manipulated yet.
Most are made of something very mysterious that we call dark matter.
Dark material is something that doesn't interact very well, except for gravity, and of course we're going to learn more about it.
If you're interested in physics particles, you're interested in what happens when we press something about each other.
And dark material is not an exception.
So how can we do that?
"If I answer this question, I'm going to answer a little different question, "What will it happen if the galaxies are reunited?""
Let's look at the image.
We remember that galaxies are like particles of the universe, only a small version.
They preferably interact with dark maths, and that's what you see in this blue burst.
Red is a hot gas, and you can actually see a lot of galaxies.
What happens here is the accelerator of particles in a very, very large space.
And it's very important, because it means that very, very small effects that are hard to get out in laboratory can connect and join something we can see in nature.
Yes, it's very fun.
The reason why galaxies can teach us what dark material is, the reason why galaxies can teach us about physics very little, that is that they're so big.
Number four: physics is very strange.
It's already shown to actually connect your head.
If there's something more strange, it has to be dark energy.
When I put the ball in the air, I'm waiting for him to fly the oven.
But I don't expect him to fly the hill with more and more speed.
So cosmologists explain why the universe is expanding.
They don't understand why it expands with more speed.
They give this reason for accelerated expansion of the name and call it dark energy.
And we also want to understand more about it.
So one special question, which is, how does dark energy influence the world in the most powerful power?
And depending on its power, the structure can buy its risks faster or more slowly.
And the problem of the universe in a large way is that it's terrible.
Let's look at the software simulation.
We need something to stop it.
I like to think about it using an analogy.
To understand Titan's flame, the most important thing is not the model of the location of every small piece of ship that broke.
The most important thing is to see the two largest parts.
So I can learn a lot about the world in the largest scale, looking after its largest parts, and these parts are galaxies' combinations.
Finally, I'm going to end my conversation, but you can feel a little scam.
I think I've started with how useful the connectivity of galaxies, and I've shown some of these reasons, but how do I actually use them?
So for answer, I want to work with Henry Ford when I asked him about cars.
"And all he said, ""If I ask people what they need, they would say they need faster horses"" The sun of our society meets a very large number of problems."
And the solution to these problems is not obvious.
They aren't faster horses.
They need an incredible number of scientific innovations.
Yes, we need to focus, yes, we need to focus, but we also need to remember innovation, innovation, inspiration, these things come when we expand our field of visibility when we step back when we look at distance.
And I think the best way to do this is to learn the world around us. Thank you.
(Applause)
"Yes, imagine you're at the street somewhere in America, and a Japanese here comes to you and says, "Do you see what this block is called?""
"And you say, ""Excuse you. Well, it's Owak stress, and it's Al Gore stress."
"It's twelve cents, and it's twelve seven."" He says, ""Well. How is it called this block?"" You say, ""You know, there are no names in the block."
"The soldiers have names; the blocks are just the unbelievable route between the streets."" They leave, they're a little distracted and disappointed."
"And now, imagine you're standing on the street, you go to Japan, you go to the person behind you and say, "Excuse what this street is called?""
"They say, ""Oh, here's a block 17, and this is a block 16."" And you said, ""Well, what's the street called?"" And they say, ""How do you say, the street has no name."
There are names in the block.
Here's a look at Google maps. Here's the block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
All these blocks have names. The waves are just the unimaginable flow between the blocks.
"And you said, ""Well, OK, but how do you know your home address?"" And Andy said, ""Well, it's just this: That's the eighth region."
"And there's a block of 17, a house number one. You're saying, ""Fina. But playing the neighborhood, I noticed that the houses are not targeted by the way."" And he said, ""It's not exactly. Number depends on the time the houses were built."
The house that was built in the block first is a house number one.
The house that was built by the second is the house number two.
"The third house is the house number three. It's simple. It's obvious."" So I really love that sometimes we need to go on the other side of the earth to understand something we didn't even have, and to understand that absolutely impossible things are possible."
Here's, for example, in China, there are doctors who believe their work is to keep your health.
So every month you're not sick, you're sick with them, and if you're not sick, you don't need to pay them because they didn't be able to deal with their work. They're rich when you're healthy, not when you're sick.
"(Applause) Even in any music, ""Risas"" is a long-term, the beginning of a musical phrase. Once, two-four."
One thing in North African music is the end of the phrase, after the end of the word.
You can hear it not only in the words, but also in the way they think of tactical music, two, three, four, once.
And this map is also correct.
(Laughter) They say that all the truth that we're talking about India is the opposite, which is also the truth.
So let's forget if you're at TED or not at the other point that, regardless of what close idea you have or you're listening to, it can also be true.
Domo arigato gozaimashita.
