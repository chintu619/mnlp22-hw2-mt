By the end of this year, there will be about a billion people on earth who are actively using satellites.
All of them combinate what they're going to die.
Since it's a horrible thought, but I think it has serious consequences that should be seen.
For the first time, I thought about it after I was posted in Dirk K. Miller, a science-tech journalist who died from cancer.
Miller asked his family and friends to write a written post published after his death.
Here's what he wrote at the beginning.
"He said, ""Well. I died, and this is my last post in the blog."
"And so I asked my body to get away from my cancer, my family and friends publish the prepared message I wrote as the first part of my blog coming from the active book."" Not only, as a journalist, Miller's arches could be written better and more accurate, the question is that today, everybody creates the archives that are completely different from what was created by any previous generation."
Let's look at a little statistics.
Now, 48 hours of video are uploaded on YouTube every week.
There are 200 million minutes per day.
The average user of Facebook creates 90 units of content per month.
When you think about your parents or grandparents and grandparents, they've actually created a couple of photos, or video, or a dayday living in a window.
But today, we're creating incredibly rich digital archives that will live in the neighborhood of unknown how much time after our death.
I think it creates incredibly intriguing capabilities for technicians.
For clarity, I'm a journalist, not a technician, so I'd like to put a picture of what the present and the future will look like.
We've already seen some services that allow us to decide what happens to our online profile and revelations in the redesign after our death.
One of them, quite a year old, found me on tea in the New York Restaurant store on Foursquare.
(Applause) Adam: Hello.
Death: Adam?
A: Yeah.
Death: Death can kill you anywhere at any time, even in Arganik.
A: Who is that?
Death: Go on ifidi.net, [""If I die.net"] until it was too late."
(Laughter) And: Okay, isn't it true?
This service makes quite simple things: you can create a message or a video that can be published on Facebook after you die.
The second service is called 1,000 memories.
It allows you to online to download your loved ones and complete it with photos, videos and stories they can publish after you die.
But then it's just interesting.
Many of you probably heard about David Rayo, who suggested how he was able to test over 90,000 hours of home video.
I think with the improvement of the ability of machines to understand human language and develop huge amounts of data, it will be able to analyz the content for life — images, photos, videos, blog messages — that we make in large quantities.
And I think as soon as this happens, our digital individuals will be able to continue interaction with the real world after our death by expanding the content that we created, and the ability of technology to give that meaning.
Now we'll look at a couple of experiments.
There's a service like this: My next Twitter, he's analyzing all your records on Twitter, everything you sent, and making predictions that you could write next.
So as you can see, the result can be chemical.
Imagine something like this will look in 5, 10 or 20 years with the improvement of technical capabilities.
Doing a step forward, MIT's laboratory media works on robots that can interact as people.
And if robots were able to interact on the basis of the unique characteristics of a person, hundreds of thousands of the content that a person created for the whole life.
Finally, remember the famous characters in the U.S. election night in 2008, when the CNN studio was translated to a whistleblower voice of the CEO of Will.I. Am'a for an interview with Anderson Kubir.
And what if we could use this technology to treat our loved ones in the hotel, interacting very realistic, based on the content they created while they lived?
I think that's completely possible, because the volume of data that we've created and the technical capabilities for their analysis increases in geometric progress.
As a result, I think we all have to think if we want this to be a reality, and if it's true to think about life and what else.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The second exception is from the head of the government.
Unfortunately, the answer to these questions is yes.
After that, you can make predictions and test them.
What do we know about complex systems?
It means that literally the system doesn't consist of its parts.
Where are economic networks?
We concentrated on my mobile networks.
The quality of businesses is determined.
"How are they organized?" "Do they work alone?"
These are companies that work in more than one country, and there are 43,000.
I'll explain by analogy.
More specifically, I want to talk about what's not the way we talk about love.
I don't know what you follow, but if I imagine this method, I see a stage with a cartoon — like this person is here, he goes on a walk without observing, he comes to the open person and moves down to the channel.
And I think it's just like this, because walking is not going to accelerate.
Puting is sudden and uncontrollable.
It's something that happens with us without our permission.
I'm a writer and also a teacher of English, which means thinking about words, I'm going to live.
You can say, and I'd like to emphasize that many methods that we use to talk about love have a problem, even a lot of them.
So in love, we love.
We are angry.
We're growing up.
We fall in tiredness.
We remember the fire.
Love makes us crazy, and it makes us sick.
Our hearts are afraid, and then they disappear.
So our metaphorizes improve someone's love for excess violence or disease.
(Laughter) Yeah.
And they position us as an eye of unpredictable and unpredictable circumstances.
"My favorite one of them is ""smitten," which appears in the past form of the word ""smite."" And if you look at the meaning of this word in the dictionary — (Laughter) you can see it means it and ""bossy failure," and ""bossy hard in love."" As a rule, I associate the word ""smite"" with a very special context, with Old Testament."
"So in one Book of Excuse, there are 16 sentences to the word ""confidence," which in the Bible is used for the Baptist of God."
(Laughter) We use the same word to talk about love explaining our six days. (Laughter)
Legal?
So how did that happen?
How did we come to relationships of love with big pain and patience?
And why do we talk about this kind of good experience, like we are victims?
These are hard questions, but I have someories.
And to explain this, I want to focus on one concrete method that reflects love as shame.
When I started studying romance for the first time, I met these methods of shame everywhere.
In the history of Western culture, there are rich languages that make love for mental illness.
Here's a few examples.
For the first time I fell in love when I was 20 years old, and it was enough unpleasant relationships from the beginning.
This was the relationship of distance for the first few years, so for me, it meant very high flights and low below.
I personally remember one moment.
I sat on a bed in a hotel in South America, and I saw my friend coming out of the door.
It was known, it was almost north, and we did the dinner, and when we came back to our room, he left his stuff in the bag and he left the press.
Even though I don't remember the circumstances of this incident, I remember very clearly how I looked at it.
When I was 22, it was my first journey in a country that evolves, and I was completely single.
It remained a week before my flight came home, and I knew the name of the city in which I was, and the name of the city I needed to get to fly, but I had no idea how to look around.
I had no checklist and very little money, and I didn't know Spanish.
Someone more courageous than I could scale it as a moment of opportunity, but I missed it.
I just sat there.
And then she was crying.
"But despite my breakdown, a little voice in my head thought, ""Wow. It was dramatically."
"I really love the right way."" (Laughter) Because some part of me wanted to feel uncomfortable in love."
Now it sounds so strange for me, but when I was 22, I tried to have dramatic experiments, and at that time, I was unconscious, angry and devastated, and it was pretty strange, but I thought that it was something that would sign my feelings to a boy who just left me.
I think at some level, I wanted to be a little crazy, because I thought it was that love and work.
"It doesn't really have to be strange, and it turns out that there are eight movies, 14 songs, two albums, and one novel called ""The Great Love."" After a half hour, he came back to our room."
We fell asleep.
But love someone in this way — like my prosperity was entirely dependent on the reciprocity of love — was not very good for me or for him.
But I think this type of love is not very unusual.
Most of us feel a little angry at the early stage of stagnation.
In fact, there's a study that proves that it's normal, because neuromy shows that stagnation and psychological disturbance aren't so easy to distinguish.
That's really true.
"This 1999 study uses blood tests to prove that the rate of serotine of love is very similar to the rate of serotine in people with the diagnosis of ""absolutely compulsory disturbance.""
(Laughter) Yes, and the rate of serotine also is linked to the syndrome of the season's effective disturbance and depression.
So there's a few evidence that love is closely linked to changes in our mood and behavior.
And other studies suggest that most relationships start in this way.
Researchers claim that a low level of serotinian is linked to an opponent thought about the object of love that reminds someone sitting in your head.
And most of us feel like being in love for the first time.
I decided that if my friends can't understand my devastating city, I don't need their friendship.
So I stopped meeting most of them.
And it was probably the most miserable year in my life.
But I think I felt that being misfortune was my job, because if I was misfortune, then I could show me how much I loved him.
And if I could prove that, then we would finally remain together.
It's a real shame, because there's no universal rule that states that big suffering leads to a great reward, but we talk about love whether it's true.
Our experience of love and biological and cultural.
Our biology says that love is good, activating the collision of awards in our brains, and she says that love loves when, after a breakthrough or a breakdown, the neurochemical reward is abolished.
In fact, you've probably heard about it, telling you about neuromy, to survive disconnection like stopping the caffeine that I'm connected.
(Laughter) So our culture uses a language to form and adapt to this idea of love.
In this case, we talk about pain, dependency and shame methods.
It's a pretty interesting exchange of feedback.
Love is powerful and sometimes angry, and we show it through our words and stories, but then our words and stories prepare us to wait for a strong and compassionate love.
It's interesting that it's happening in a culture that shines my life.
By being, we want early and cruel love, and we want it to continue her entire life.
It sounds horrible.
(Laughter) To control this, we need to change our culture or change our expectations.
Imagine we'd be less passionful in love.
If we were more confident, more open to the new, more cheerful, and instead of being in love, we would come into it.
I know that this requires a lot of things, but I'm not the first person who offers it.
"In the book ""The Metaphers we live"" the linguists Mark Johnson and George Laykaph offer an interesting solution to this detail: we need to change our metaphers."
They claim, and they can even act as leaders of our future jobs, as progressive projects.
John and Laykapp offer a new love metaphor: Love as a collective art.
I like this way of thinking about love very much.
The linguists say that metaphors follow the logic that, in essence, there's a way to look at all the subjects or ideas that contain the metaphor.
John and Laykoff are talking about all the things that collaboration on art is leading to: exile, conversation, perseverance, general goals.
These ideas are well suited to our cultural inclusion in long-term romance relationships, but they also work well in other kinds of relationships — short-term, casual, free, impossible, unconscious — because these metaphores bring much more complicated ideas to experience someone's love.
So if love is a joint creature of art, then love is an estetic experience.
Love is unpredictable, love is creative, love requires collaboration and discipline, frustrates and wins emotional emissions.
And love is made of compassion and pain.
In fact, every love experience is different.
When I was young, I never thought you could't accept everything that offered love.
When a fourth-year-old Judith met for the first time, if a fourth-year-old Judith couldn't be without Rome, who she met four days ago, she wasn't disappointed or fascinated.
Where is she?
She wants to die.
Yeah?
And as a reminder, at this moment of drinking, action third and fifth, Rome won't die.
He's alive, he's healthy, he's just released from the city.
I understand that Vera of the 16th century is similar to modern North America, but when I read this drink for the first time, at the age of 14, the potatoes of Judith had a meaning for me.
To transform love as something I create with someone I love, not just what happens to me without my control or consent, it gives me the inner power.
But it's still hard.
Love is sometimes absolutely inevitable and devastating, and when I feel tired, I have to remind myself: my job in these relationships is to talk to my partner about what I want to do with me.
It's also not easy.
But it's much better than the second option in which love is shame.
This is the version of love not about being attracted or losing attention.
Instead, it requires trusting her partner and measuring the situation when it becomes difficult to believe that sounds very simple, but in fact, the revolutionary radioactive action.
Because you need to stop thinking about yourself and your acquisition or loss in these relationships, and start thinking you can offer.
"This version of love allows us to tell things like, ""Hey, we're not very good collaborators. You can't be for us.""
"Because, ""This relationship was more cruel than I've planed, but it was so wonderful."" The whole art was good for it's not going to kiss or not kill himself."
This version of love allows us to explain how it looks like.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Even a week in 95s, I was another student with my friend driving a car from the city of Provedans, which is the city of Rood Айланд, to the city of Portland, which is in Algeria, only 5,000 miles.
But you know what it goes when you're young and unemployed — we didn't walk through the streets, beyond the north of the national parks, national spaces, by course, by the longest path.
(Laughter) I came back to my friend a week in South Tokyo, and I asked me that I had already visited 3000 miles.
"What's the icon that's all over the north of the road?"
Her eyes were out on the bed.
The boss sitting in the first place is very precise now that her face looks like.
(Laughter) So here I said to her, "You know, these signs along the path that with the Chinese anglophone."
What I'm about?
(Laughter) Here's he, this famous heroic place for pizza. (Laughter)
In the past five years, I've been thinking about this kind of situation — why we sometimes misunderstand the signs of why, and how we behave when the misunderstanding happens, and what we all know about human nature.
In other words, I spent the last five years in thinking about the condition of failure.
My career choice may seem to be unusual, but it has a huge benefit: lack of competition at work.
(Laughter) In fact, most of us would actually run from the fire to think about their misfortune or not trying to think about the ability of their disability.
Absolutely, we understand this.
We understand that sometimes everybody in this room is wrong.
We are people, we have a mistake. Okay, let's go.
But when it comes to me, in this moment, my belief in this data, suddenly all the abstract views of human need to fly before, and I can't imagine that I'm wrong.
What interesting is that we live in this data time.
In them, we go to a meeting, they want to go to a vacant, they want to go to a cloud and give their voice.
In practice, it turns out that we all run through life in a way of belief that we're always right.
I like this a problem.
In my opinion, it's a problem like each and every one of us, at personal or professional level, as well as all of us together as society.
What I want to know today is the first foundation because we're lying in the senses of our rules.
Secondly, it's why this approach is problematic.
And finally, I want to convince you that the opportunity to get out of this sense, and if you're going to do it, it's the best of all the ways that you're going to go to dream, wisdom and creativity that you can do.
Why do we stand up in our senses of our listening?
One condition is linked to the feeling of failure.
Let's ask you, maybe you're here, because you're here. What are the emotions that happen when you're not right?
Courage. Courage. Courage.
Integrity. Okay, cool, super.
Compassionate, with unconscious sense, with a sense of comfort, thank you, they all are file answers, but they answer the other question.
You answer the question: "What feeling makes you feel wrong."
(Laughter) Understanding your misfortune makes yourself feel like it was said, and still the entire spectrum, right?
For example, it might be a terrible feeling, whether it's a feeling of humiliation of understanding, or even a funny feeling like my crazy Chinese English speaker.
But the condition of failure itself doesn't cause any emotion.
So here's an example of analogy.
Do you remember the multiverse of the Lune Cunns company, where is such a missionary boat going to run all the time, but doesn't it match the running escape?
For example, in every episode of this series, it turns out that the boat is running behind the shore, and that flows from the left corner that's not difficult because the shore is a bird and can fly.
But every time the boat flys from the rocks now beyond the shuttle.
What funny is, especially if you're only six years old is that it's also difficult for cats.
He just keeps walking until he looks at the dollar and understands what he sees in the air.
Here's what he starts to drop.
When we're wrong, not if we understand what we're wrong, but that's what we're like, we're like this tea, then we're going to look back, but we're going to look down.
You know, we've been wrong, we're going to have to deal with it, but we still feel confident on earth.
I have a little to translate what I'd like to say.
There's a feeling of misfortune — it's a feeling of your rights.
(Laughter) Because of this structured result, we're never connected to the senses of our rights.
I call this mistake blind.
And more importantly, we don't have a mechanism that would say if we're wrong until we know.
There's another reason why we're waiting for this sense, and it's more about culture.
Imagine a little early school.
You're a seat, and the teacher's seat back, and one of them looks like this.
Yes, it's not my.
(Laughter) Here's you're in your school, and you know exactly what you think about a classman who received that degree.
He's stupid and sad, he's never doing homework.
So until you were nine years old, you've learned that, first, those who are wrong are false, uncontrolled chickens, and second, to succeed in life, you can never be wrong.
We study these bad eyes very much easier.
Most of us, and as I think, especially in this room, relying on this lesson is made of unpredictable wonders, perfectionists, friends.
Isn't he, the CEO of finance, the same as an astrophysician, is he a super marathon?
(Laughter) And as it turns out, you're all such directors, astrophysics and marathonists.
Let's be.
The situation is worse only when we're doing that we may have wrong.
Because thinking in this way when we're doing a mistake, we're going to say something isn't like us.
So we insist on our own, because this is what we feel smart, accountable, well-being and protective.
Let's tell you about the case.
A few years ago, a woman named Beth Israel Deacon took a woman to surgery.
This hospital is located in Boston.
In this hospital, students go from Harvard, and he is one of the best in the country.
This woman was accepted and engaged in the operating room.
She was put under the drug, the surgeon manipulates her, then he pushes her, and he's prosecuted to the postoperative palace.
Of course, the operation went normal.
The woman starts, she looks back, and she says, "Why am I not connected to that face?" And she's connected to that face because the surgeon did a serious operation on her left foot, not on her right.
When the secretary of the hospital was talking about it as a processor, he said something very interesting.
"In the unknown reason, the surgeon just felt that he was working on the right side."" (Laughter) Why I tell you about it, because believing your sense of what you're at the right sight of something might be very dangerous.
This inner sense of all the senses that we all experience sometimes can't be believed as the only perception of what actually happens in the outside world.
And if we're just in our behavior, we're looking at this water, and we don't even think about the potential of our misfortune, we're making stupidity like burning 700 million pounds of oil in the West of Mexico, or neutralization of global economy.
It's a giant problem for practice.
But it's also a giant problem for society.
Think about a minute that means feeling your rights.
This means your beliefs soundly reflect the reality.
With this feeling, there's a problem that's an explanation for all those people that are misconvenient with you.
It turns out that most of us would explain to ourselves people with other views using the string of misconception.
The first thing we usually think if someone of us is misconvenient is that we admit they're not aware of those questions.
They just don't have access to the information that you have, and if you've shared this information with them, they're going to go to your camp.
If it doesn't happen when we realize that they have the same facts with us, but they continue to talk to us, we move on the side of the second thought, that they are ideas.
(Laughter) For them, they need all the pieces of composition, and they, the apples, can't collect them.
And when it doesn't work when we realize that people who don't talk to us have the same facts and they're pretty smart, we're going to the third opinion, they know the truth, but for their own punishing purposes, the truth will end up.
This is a disaster.
This commitment to reject our rules doesn't allow us to avoid mistakes, especially when it's necessary, and makes us feel bad to each other.
What makes me more tired, I think it's tragic, which is a situation that is absolutely separated from our human essence.
By the way, we want to believe that our minds are those unbelievable windows that we can see them closely and clearly describe the universe.
And we want everyone to observe the universe through the same glass and see exactly the same.
It's not true, and if it was, the world would be incredibly boring.
The magic of our mind is not that we can see the world he is.
He is that we can see the world not the same as there is.
We can have memories of being, thinking about the future, and we can imagine whether we are other people in other places.
It's because everybody sees a little different way, and we can see the same screwdriver in the sky and see it, and that's that, and that's that.
That's why we're wrong.
In 1200 years before David interpreted his famous words, "I think I'm going to exist," he named St. Augustine wrote, "fallor ergo sum" — "I'm wrong and knowing exist."
Augustine realized that the fact of our ability to make mistakes is not the unfortunate effect of the human system, nothing to prevent or kill.
This is the foundation of our humanity.
Because we're not God, we don't know what is happening in this world.
Unlike other animals, we're constantly trying to capture this world.
I think it's an infinite distance that is the root and the output of all our productivity and creative imagination.
Last summer, from different reasons, I started listening to many publishers of the program "This American Life" on the social radio.
And I listened, I listened, and I started to feel that all the knowledge was about being misfortune.
At the beginning, I thought, "I'm happy.
Now I'm always seeing misfortune as crazy.
I think it's everywhere."
But over a couple of months, I had the opportunity to interview Iris Glas's correspondent program.
I shared this opinion with him, and he said to me, "It's really that."
He added that the programmer's creators even joke that in every release, this is the same subject.
She goes somewhere like this: "I thought that was going to get this, and it really happened differently." "What's interesting," said Iris Glas, "It's all that we need this information.
We need moments of misunderstanding and changes of misunderstanding to make these stories."" What's like us all, the authors, as listeners or readers, is that stories are like this.
We like the transformation of the story, the creative steps and the unpredictable ends.
What's about our stories, we want to be wrong.
But you know that our stories are like this, because our lives are like this.
We think it's going to happen, and it's actually different.
George Buss thought he would attack Iraq, and he would find weapons of mass destruction there, liberate people and trust the democracy of the Middle East.
And it really happened differently.
But also, Jose Muobrac thought he would be Egyptian dictator until he was standing up and growing up, and then he could transfer his own power to his son.
And it really happened differently.
Maybe you've ever thought you would stay and join your loved school, come back to your home city and predict how many kids together.
And it really happened differently.
I have to admit that I thought I was going to write the latest book about something that doesn't work to anyone, for readers that would never be.
And it really happened differently.
(Laughter) That's the same life.
We're developing incredible ideas about the universe, sometimes it's a better way, sometimes not, and the world is prevalent and fascinates us.
Don't worry, but all this conference is like a reminder of our ability to make mistakes.
We've spent a week talking about innovation, improvements and transformation, but you know why do we need these innovations, improvements and transformation?
Because half of the ideas that were crazy and had the opportunity to change the world — look at TED in 1998, what is there?
(Laughter) didn't work, didn't it? (Laughter)
Where's my shortcut, Chris? (Laughter)
(Applause) And we're here again.
And this will continue.
We'll find another idea.
We'll tell another story.
We're participating in another conference.
The topic of today, as you've heard seven million times, is how to invent beauty again.
So if you really want to find a wonderful thing again, then go beyond this tiny and fearful space of your right and look at each other, and also look at the immortality, the complexity and the secret of the universe and let yourself say, "I don't know.
Maybe I'm wrong." Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you all. (Applause)
On October 5th of the 1990s, a person called El-Said Nahar entered the hotel in Montreal and killed Mary Khan's rabbi, the leader of the Liber Liberation of Hebrew.
For the first time, Nabaro recognized the unknown in the murder, but when he was punished for other crimes, he and his collaborators started planning attacks on a series of New York celebrators, including panels, sinagogues and the assembly of the United States.
Fortunately, these plans were made by the FBD's infarcher.
But unfortunately, the explosion in 1993 in the World Trade Center failed.
As a result, Nabaro was judged for participating in the capacity.
Al-Said Nahar is my father.
I was born in Petersburg, Penn State, in 1993, in a family of an Egyptian engineer and a kid-hearted mother of America, teachers in early classes, and Dad together tried to make my childhood happy.
But when I was seven years old, the relationship in our family began to change.
My father showed me the same side of Islam that little people had to see, including even most Muslims.
My experience shows that when people meet each other, they don't need a lot of time to understand that in principle, we all want each other and the same.
However, in every religion, there will be a little percent of people in every nation who are so fitfully adhering to their beliefs that they feel the need to use any means to make others live according to their rules.
A few months later, his father sent me and told me that a few last weekend, he and his friends went to London Island for training.
He said I'll go with him next morning.
We went to the Calverton Street, which we were looking back to the FBD.
At that day, my last astronaut ran into a small orange lamp on the top of the mosque, and, at all-always, and especially my, the flame fell in all of the mosque.
"My grandfather came back to my friends and said in Arabic, ""I'm Abou." Who's a father, like a son."
They've all understood this future very strongly, but only a few years later, I realized her meaning completely.
They saw me the same destructor as my father was.
As a result, people were judged for the fallout of the truck, which was driven by families of kilometers of explosion in the underground park on the north side of the World Trade Center, which led the explosion to death of six people, and the deaths were over a thousand.
These were the men I was full of.
"These people I called ""am," which means ""Thank you.""
Every time I started to feel comfortable at one place, it was time to show things and move to another city.
When I was always a new face in the classroom, I was often a mix of fluogans.
I've learned to judge people on the basis of casual circumstances like religion or race.
What opened me my eyes?
The first event that ended up showing this image of thinking occurred during President's election in the 2000s.
Through the preparation program, I was able to participate in the National Youth Movement in Philadelphia.
Members of our group introduced the most different plaques of society.
One day, closer to the end of the journey, I learned that one of my new friends was a slave.
I had never had Hebrew friends yet, and, in fact, I was proud of that I turned the barier into the imperfectness that I believed almost all my life.
Another breakthrough moment was the summer design in the bush garden, and it was a park of attraction.
There I saw people of the most different religions and cultures, and this experiment became fundamental in building my personality.
And some of the blood that I've experienced when I was a kid, I felt that I had the sense of being compassionate to ask others, and for me, I'm not natural to stand up to other good people as I wanted to stand up to me.
This feeling allowed me to compare the stereotypes that taught me in childhood with my life experience.
And then there was the daily show. Every night, John Start made me honest with myself after my own fanatism, and he helped me understand that race, religion or sexual attention didn't have anything to share with personalities.
In many ways, he changed me the father I needed that I needed then.
The inspiration often comes from where you don't expect it completely, and now I know that the Hebrew Komik has influenced my worldview more positive than my father's extreme.
One day, I talked to my mother about how I started to change my vision of light, and she told me something that I'd keep my whole life in my heart.
At that moment, I realized how much negative energy is required to keep this unknown inside me.
Because Abraham is not my real name.
I took him when my family decided to break up relationships with my father and start a new life.
Why do I open my person and potentially undergoes myself a danger?
Yes, it's simple.
Instead, I use my experience in fighting terrorism, in fighting fanatism.
I'm doing this for victims of terrorism and their parents, for terrible pain and loss that caused them to be part of terrorism.
In memory of the victim of terrorism, I'm fighting these misconvenient actions, and I judge my father's actions.
I'm here as evidence that violence is not an unconscious part of religion or race, and that my son is not bound to keep his father's journey.
I'm not my father.
(Applause) Thank you all. (Applause) Thank you all. (Applause) Thank you all. (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause)
But it can't be so.
I'm the one who likes chocolate strawberries.
I've learned what I've been doing in these 30-day experiments.
This picture is from my experiment when I did a picture every day in the moon.
I never liked beauty.
She's horrible.
They are actually the greatest.
(Applause)
I was incredibly happy to be born in a country that was considered the best place in the world to be a woman.
In 1975 when I was seven years old, women in Iceland went to leave.
At that day, they didn't work, regardless of whether they had a job or just a house job.
They went to the Reckiewicz Center, 90 percent of the women involved, and the peaceful and solidarity asked about equality.
Nothing worked in Iceland at that day because nothing works when women don't.
(Applause) Five years later, Iceland had the courage to become the first country in the world that a democracy path called a woman as president.
I'll never forget that day when President Higgs, known as us, came out to the bathroom of his house, the mother alone with her daughter, after his victory.
(Applause) She became an amazing model for change for me and anyone who grew up at that time including boys.
She often told her a story about a guy who came to her after a few hours on the board, and she said, "And the guys can also be president when they grow up?" (Laughter) The role models really have a meaning, but even with so powerful transformations that I'm very grateful if I was offered to be a president's office, my first response was, "Who's this way to pay attention to this post?
Who's I like to be President?" It turns out that women are less likely to try to be a leader than men.
A study conducted in the U.S. in 2011, showed that 62 percent of the men looked at their candidate for President, but only 45 percent of the women.
We see breakthroughs in 16 percent, and that's the same breakthrough that existed a decade ago.
It's a real shame, because I'm confident that this world needs leadership and leadership in general.
So my solution to fight finally was that I felt the need to make my contribution, even without any political challenge, go forward and try to participate in creating a world that would have a meaning to drive for our kids, where we really let me be able to make a boy and girls achieve everything they want.
It was the journey of my entire life.
It was amazing.
The journey started with 20 potential candidates.
After the graduation, the number was connected to nine candidates, and finally the race came to us four, three men and me.
(Applause) But it's not a drama yet.
Maybe you think there are trees here in the United States, but I can — (Laughter) I can say that we're not worse in Iceland.
At the beginning, the president who's the last 20 years found that it's not going to pay, it may be, and it's led to so many candidates.
And then he thought when our boss gave a report because of the very famous Panama papers that he and his family were involved.
There was a folclus protest in Iceland, because the president told the country that he needed a recognized leader.
And a few days later, his wife and her family were also found in Panama papers, and he left the race again.
Before he was sitting, he explained what he did, because there are two skilled men now who can become his annual rangers.
So nine September, 45 days after the election, the question wasn't too good for me.
I didn't even have a place in the newspaper chart.
According to a survey, I had one percent, but all of them, it was the highest position among women in the audience.
It's going to be a change to say that I've been given an example of all the encouragement to get my seat behind and get to TV because the television decided to include only candidates with a minimum of 2.5 percent of the voice in the first television.
At the day of these detectors, I'd found that I'd be going to participate there with three men, and during the era, I learned that I received an accumulation of 2.5 percent a day of the first detectors.
(Applause) And about the problems.
The fundamental problems that we had to meet and deal with on this journey were linked to media, support and play.
Let's start with media.
Some claim that sex doesn't mean media and politics.
I can't agree.
I found it harder to get access to both the media and the energy time.
In fact, the leader candidate emerged in the public media 87 times a few months before the election, while I emerged there 31 times.
And I don't say that media makes it consciously.
I think there's a reason in an unknown page, because in the media, in a larger part, like everywhere, there's a known and unknown page, and we need the courage to talk about it when we want to change.
When I finally got access to TV, the first question was like, "Do you plan to remove your candidate?" It was a hard question.
Of course, with one to 2,5 percent of the answers in the interviews, you can understand it.
But the media really matters, and every time I came to TV, we saw and felt an increase in the interviews, so I don't know by listening how important it is and why we should talk about it.
One of the four final candidates I had never had an interview at the first place.
Sometimes I was left behind the questions that were asked for all the rest of the candidates, and beyond the light of the choices.
I met it, but I'll tell you a computer of Icelandic media.
There was almost no comment from my hair or clothes.
(Applause) Let them write.
But there's another very important experience.
I was proud as an independent candidate without any political party or support.
This lack of experience and access to resources, perhaps, would have gone beyond our company, but also allowed us to introduce new and do different policies.
Our company was positive, and so we probably changed the tone of choices for others.
I was the reason for a little bit of time on TV because I wanted to show attention to another printer.
When access to media was incredibly complicated, we launched our own information resources.
I conducted online interviews on Facebook, while I answered any choice questions.
All the questions that we received together with the answers, we've been able to open access to Facebook because we believed the importance of using when you want to create trust.
When I found a problem to pay attention to young players, I started using Snapchat.
Prayer showed me how to do that, and I used every filter in Snapchat during the last part of the company.
I really needed a lot of rubber and room, because I was a prophan here.
But because of that, we have grown the number of participants in the youth.
It turns out that it's possible to know a company and otherwise.
Unfortunately, we can't talk about politics and we can't remember money.
It's sad that it's true, but it's true, and we had less financial resources than we had any other candidates.
Maybe the reason was partly that, in my opinion, time was unbelievable to ask for financial support.
And maybe I tried to do more with smaller profits.
Some say that it's very night.
But even with the third media and financial resources, and only with a entrepreneur but a wonderful team, we could surprise everyone on the day of choices when the first numbers came.
I was surprised by myself as you can see on the picture.
(Laughter) In the first data, I went together with a leading candidate.
(Applause sounds) Well, too early, because I couldn't win, but I took the second place, and we went a long way from one percent to almost a third part of the voice, and we took the research by an unprecedented breakdown, and the result was 10 percent bigger than the last study.
Because of this, some call me a real winning of choices, and many people invited me to fight again.
But in fact, it makes me proud of knowing that I've earned Propartically a higher percentage of support from the youth, and a large number of people have trained my daughter to fight in 2040.
(Applause) Now she was 13 and she was never on TV yet.
But on the day of the election, I had never seen her on TV, she was smart, confident, she was honest and supported her mother.
Maybe it was the biggest moment of my company.
(Applause) But there was another one.
During the fallout, the girls of the injured age saw my poster at the bus station and were burning the need to kiss him.
Audience: Oh!
This impression is already a victory for me.
We can achieve everything we see.
The black fear and problems.
(Applause) Women need leadership, and it's time women to fight, let it be a leader or a president.
"And I also managed to imagine your native magazine ""The New Yorkker."" And I had a new title: "The Real dream of truth."" (Thank you) Maybe this is my most popular title, because women are too often punished for the benefit of emotional capitan as I call him, but I know with my own experience that we're going to win only when we do that."
(Applause) And we need to use it more.
On the day of choices, we celebrate whether we could win because we felt like this.
It's imperative to do that position.
You just need to go to this, and you, your family and friends, all who are going to work with you if you work well, you grow up above everything you've experienced before.
We spent a good time, and I'm rich about what I learned during this journey, more than I can tell you today's meeting.
But be sure, it was a hard job.
I didn't sleep much during those months.
We needed courage and empathy to avoid leaving, and I finally realized what I knew another day of one percent: you can only listen to yourself and act in accord with this inner voice.
As my good sister speaks, you can undermine your intuition, but intuition never undermine you.
I also want to emphasize, and you all know this, the key thing in your journey is your team.
People who share your values and your vision, but differ in the other.
For me, it's a form of success, and I'm blazing with a wonderful husband, who is here today, an amazing family — (Applause) and great friends, and we went out as entrepreneurs on the political line and made something, by people's words, impossible.
In fact, the main social specialist told me how I received a solution that would be good when I get 7 percent.
I clarified his point of view, because maybe he had the right, and he found his opinion on a valuable challenge.
But on the day of one percent, I decided to show that he was wrong.
It's really important to know it, because I really was very little sleeping and still working like people behind me.
We're never able to achieve a lot when we're going to forget the question about ourselves.
I think there are two very important points in this case: attack themselves with people and things that saturate you, but not less importantly, if not more, having the courage to avoid people and actions that pick your energy, including amazing blogers and comments.
This was the whole support of others, and I decided not to focus on abrasions, partly because my energy was consumed all that time.
When I lost energy at some point — and it happened time from time to time, because it was not easy — I turned into my thoughts to talk about my reasons, not just right, but by my rules.
I called our 4G company where the letter G means Icelandic words.
The first of them is "Gagna." I was proud to do good, to be useful, and I wanted that the concept of leadership as a service was the center of our work during the winning company.
The second word is "Laughter," or joy.
I decided to do this journey.
It could take a lot of them, regardless of whether it was achieved.
And I did all the efforts to inspire others.
The third word is "Gagna." I was open for all questions.
I didn't have a secret, I could have learned everything on Facebook or on our websites.
I think choosing the president, you deserve answers to your questions.
The least important word of the end that we don't have to explain in this room is that we're a large company based on Girlpower, a woman's power.
(Applause sounds) I'm incredibly glad that I found the courage to fight, to risk racing, but to get success in many ways.
I can't say it was simple, but I'm sure, and I think all my team would agree that it was worth it.
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
Pat Mitchell: I'm not going to leave you yet. Halla Thomasitzer: What good listeners. PM: I can't leave you without telling you.
(Laughter) Maybe everybody in this room is ready to go to Iceland and vote for you.
We're probably going to have the right to voice there, but there's something we can take in Iceland, like before, that's an inspiration.
I think it's pretty old enough to remember 1975 when the women of Iceland went out to the street, and it really became a big factor when women started moving.
You've been sent to this event earlier. Let's read the picture to remind you how a country looked like that.
And you can't know, because the American media didn't report that, but the Sunday, the Israeli women went out again on the street, right?
HC: Yeah. PM: Can you tell us about that?
HC: 41 years after that breakdown, we can be considered the best place in the world to be a woman, but our job isn't done.
So on Monday, in 14,38, women in Iceland left their job, because that's the time they earned their daily salary.
(Applause) And it was really powerful that young girls and boys were participating in a larger amount than before, because it was time to eliminate their wage breakthroughs.
PM: I'm not going to ask Hall now about her future plans, but I'll say you'll have a huge charity arm when you decide to do it again.
Thank you, Halla.
HC: Thank you all.
(Applause)
In fact, I tried to think about my career since I left the White House, and the best example I had was the utility in The New Yorkker a couple of years ago.
"The young boy looking at his father says, ""Tata, when I grow up, I want to be an ex President."" (Laughter) I had a great blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
They interprete these rules to convince women are usually condescending their relationship positions compared to men in the eyes of God.
So they've published a sentence that, in essence, allows women to be priest, priest, customs, economics in the church, or priest in the arm when a woman learns in the class at the Southern Baptist seminar, she can't teach when a boy is in the room because you can find a poem in the Bible, and in the Bible, more than 30,000 versions, where it is said that a woman doesn't have to teach a man, and so forth.
But the key thing is that books are incorrectly interpreted to keep men in a higher position.
Why should I pay them the same reward for making the same job?
In the United States, for example, we had a huge increase in poverty's abrasions, mostly dark people and minorities planted in prison.
Now, 7.3 people from 1,000 are in prison.
This is a surrogate increase.
Since I left the White house, there was an increase of 800 percent of dark women in prison.
We're one of the few countries on Earth, which still has a death generation, which is a developed country.
We're now in California, and I learned a day that California paid four billion dollars to judge 13 people for death penalty.
One of them is the abduction of the genital organs.
Sometimes, in more extreme cases, a girl can take off the pencil.
And then when she gets married, the same break opens the window so that you can make sex.
It's not a rare thing, but it's also against the law.
In Egypt, for example, 91 percent of all women living in Egypt today were sexually released in this way.
In some countries, it's over 98 percent of the women who are subjected to the age of age.
This is a terrible poverty for all the women living in those countries.
Another very serious thing is that a family with a misinterpretation is that there's nothing in Koran that tells it is killing a girl from her family when she was assaulted or when she married or sometimes even when she's wearing a dress.
It's going to be members of his family, so the family becomes a killer when a girl causes so-called shame to the family.
Not so long, an UN study was conducted in Egypt, and he showed that 75 percent of those deaths were conducted by parents, children and brothers, 25 percent of the deaths were conducted by women.
The other problem that exists in the world in getting women is slavery, or humiliation, as it's now called.
About 12.5 million people were sold to the New World in the 19th and 18th centuries.
30 million people live in slavery today.
The U.S. government department has to pay debt every year, and the U.S. Department reports, through international frontier every year, 80 percent of those sold — women who get sexual slavery.
In the United States, at that moment, 60,000 people live under a genotype or in slavery.
Atlanta, Georgia, which is the Carter Center, and where I study at EMU, between 200 and 300 women, people.
This is the number one place in the country because of that.
There are also many passengers in Atlanta.
If a burglar owner wants to buy a girl who has a useful thing, they can do it for 1,000 dollars.
The Belarusian girl will bring the average boss of birel in Atlanta will earn about $3000 from rob.
Alex Mandal in Atlanta, Georgia,
This causes one of the worst problems that women buy and sell in all countries in the world.
Sweden has a good approach to that.
About 20 to 20 years ago, Sweden decided to change the law, and women aren't judged by the law when they're in sexual slavery, but the owners of the burglar, the cousins and — (Applause) — the Constitution went into a legacy.
In the United States,
One man arrested 25 women were arrested in the United States.
Canada, Ireland, I've already said, Sweden, France and other countries move now to this.
This is another thing that can be done.
We have two large institutions in the country, our army and a great university system.
The army is analyzed.
The last report I received said that the army was 26,000.
Only 3000, a number of more than one percent, and the reason is that the team of any organization is a ship like my underwater boat or an eclipse in the marching boat is that the team has the right to make a decision on building a criminal business and, of course, the last thing they want to do that under their team in this way.
This law has to be modified.
The Justice Department says, on the campus campus, it's done because outside the university system, when they assault someone, but when they get to college campus.
They're not examining.
These are things that happen in our society.
When I became President, the difference was 39 percent.
So we've achieved some progress, and so forth — (Applause) (Laughter) — but in the past 15 years, there was only about 23 or 24 percent of the difference in the past 15 years.
That's what happens now.
If you take 500 companies, 23 of them are leading women, and 500 of them, and these leaders, I'll tell you, they're going to earn less than the rest of the leaders.
That's what happens in our country.
Another problem with the United States is that we're the world's most dominant.
We were in the end of the war exactly since World War II.
Sometimes our soldiers were on the place of walking.
In other ways, we were flying over the head, shining bombes on people.
And sometimes, of course, we have a pilot now.
We were in a war with 25 different countries or more after World War II.
For four years, I won't say who we didn't war — (Applause) — we didn't kill any bomb, we didn't shoot.
But in any case, those things, the return to violence and the wrong explanation of holy scriptures, are the fundamental reasons for violence against women.
Another fundamental reason, Al Gore, is to fly men.
(Applause) That's true.
The normal man who can say, calmly, gets a positive condition, it's very similar to when I was young when compassion and equality coincided.
But over this time, there was a lot of white people who didn't think that discrimination was acceptable, but they were mad because they used the privileged unique access to the justice of the richest, the best schools and all the rest, and that's the same thing that's happening today, because the normal man, in fact, is the same.
"And even when they say, ""I'm against discrimination, they're using a random condition."
What's the fundamental thing we need to do today?
I'd like, the best thing we could do for women from powerful countries like this, and where you are born, Europe and so forth, who has an influence to take responsibility to be more persuaded to end racial discrimination around the world.
But I hope that after this conference, women will persuade their men about violence in college campuses and in the army and etc., and in the future on the workplace, they need to protect their daughters and neighbors.
I have 12 sons, four kids and 10 truthers, and I often think of them, and I think about them, and I'm not just when they live in Egypt to have equal rights, and I hope you all join me to be champions for women around the world, and protect them human rights.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s, the future of the world seemed dead.
The explosion of the population was not going to stop.
The global hunger was inevitable.
Cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to destroy our lives.
The cold rain flowed above the woods.
The oil would end, and the nuclear weather would end up to us.
With me, my average life duration increased by 30%.
Child death has changed for two thirds.
Producing food for the population grew up for a third.
The number of steps on the graph detects the death of the population, and this graph shows GDP for the population's soul.
In other words, you have to understand how ideas make sex.
I want you to imagine how we went from creating such objects to creating these objects.
Of course, there were some changes, but the device changed slowly than the skeletal in the same time.
It's a great phenomenon, but it's true.
The object is structured in five years.
And more than that, with a combination of different ideas, the ideas of plastic, the ideas of laser, the ideas of transistor.
They were together in this technology.
And it's a computer, it's a collective technology that intrigues me, because I think it's the key to understand what's happening in the world.
My body is also a collection of ideas: the idea of skin cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of skin cells.
They gathered together.
How does evolution do something interdependent or unified?
She's using a pollination.
One is dying to survive the other.
In the species with a palace dispersion, it's possible for a person to get a legacy of mutation in different lines.
So sex allows people to overcome genetic innovations of all kinds.
It doesn't interfere with personal nature.
What process has the same effect in the culture that sex has in the biological evolution?
I think the answer is exchange, the habit to exchange one thing to another.
This is the unique human risk.
No animal does that.
It might be such an obsessional culture.
In Esperanto, the box has a culture.
They learn each other to traditions that are translated from parents to our grandparents.
Sponge games have different cultures in different games.
There is no exchange of ideas between them.
So why does change increase life standards?
The answer came from David Ricardo in 1817.
I'm writing his opinion in a version of the Roman century, which he also explained in terms of trade between countries.
Adam makes a wrist in four hours and shepherd in three hours.
Oz produces a wrist in one hour and a syringle in two hours.
Oz is better than Adam in a piece and a sock and a dragon.
He doesn't need Adam.
He can do his own holes and siblings.
Adam and Oz were moving at the hour of their time.
When you start first, you have to go to the village.
How much is this zombie? Have you spent a lot of time.
How much do you have to work for an hour of nightlight now to read if you have a average wage in Britain?
The object was made for me by other people.
How exact a man did it?
Thirty? Hundred? Thirty? Thirty?
You know, I think, millions.
And this is the way society works.
That's what we've achieved as a biological challenge.
In ancient times, when you were rich, people were literally working on you.
498 people cook him dinner every day.
In fact, there are other animals working each other.
Smiles are a classic example.
The Queen is responsible for nature.
(Applause) When did these behavior start?
But I don't have any evidence of that.
And the beauty of this system is that it's useful for both eyes.
And the man knows that he doesn't have to bite to make a pencil.
They were very cooperative.
They were very intelligent.
But there's no evidence that they had a pale division of work.
There's no evidence of getting together among women.
It looks like women were flying together with men.
There's also no evidence of exchange between groups, because found among the neanderthal parts of projects, the tools they've done are always made from local materials.
For example, in Lukashenko, there's a place where local neanderthal devices were invented.
They are always made from local cream.
When a person began to transform objects in this way, it serve as evidence that they changed between groups.
Gandhi is ten times older than earthquake.
And the early evidence of this is discovered somewhere 80 to 120 thousand years ago in Africa, where we see that oxytocin, jasmine and other objects are far away from Ethiopia.
Also, cancers, which were invented here in Oxford, went 200 kilometers of a mother's angle from the interplanetary Algeria.
And this is evidence that people's groups started exchange.
And that led to specialization.
What happens if you can limit people from exchange, from the ability to change and specialize?
The answer is that it's not just to stop technical progress, but it can even restore it in the opposite way.
An example of this is Tasmania.
The Taliban were isolated.
Let's go back to the image and ask ourselves, not only who did it and for whom, but who knew how to do it?
Nobody, literally no one.
"I'm actually reading the famous essay of Leonard Ridd, an economist of the 1950s called ""I, Olvock,"" in which he wrote how the olvock is made, and that no one knows how to do olvock because people in the collection don't know how to get a graph, and they don't know how to plant trees and all of that piece."
What we've done in the modern society, in the way of exchange and specialization, we've created the opportunity to do things that we don't even understand.
It's not the same thing in the language.
Now, so I'm not interested in intelligence debate or any groups have more IQ than other groups.
This doesn't mean absolutely.
In society, it matters how good people communicate their ideas, and how good they cooperate, not how smart one person is.
We created a collective brain.
We're just nodes in the network.
We're the neurons of this brain.
Integrally, the idea, the encounter and the mix of ideas are one of the leading technical progress gradually, step by step.
However, the bad things happen.
In the future, as we move forward, terrible things will happen.
So we're going to be wars, depression, natural catolicisms.
The terrible things happen in this century, I'm absolutely confident.
Thank you.
(Applause)
