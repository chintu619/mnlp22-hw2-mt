Now, this year, we're going to have a billion people in the planet, and we're going to use smart computers.
Needless of them come together with something they can memorize.
Now, this is a terrible thought, but I think this has profound implications to look at.
So I thought about it after a slogan in David C. Millary, the research journal, who died from cancer.
My work was asked by his family and friends to write a mystery that was published after his death.
This is what he said at the beginning.
"He said, ""Hey. I died, and that's my last dish."
"I asked my body to get rid of the river's suffering, my family and I interviewed a solution that I wrote as the first part of my sketch to the military."" It's not clear that, like the Magazine magazine, Millira would be a writer, and it would be much more intelligent to think about, on the right, that today, all the articles would be very different from what was going on the next generation."
Let's look at a little bit of heritage.
Today, 48 hours of video are being loaded on YoeTub, which is wrong.
That's 200 million people's loans.
The consumer consumer bill generates 90 percent of the content per month.
If you think about your parents or grandparents, in the best case, they created a few images of the picture, or video, or the door that's hidden in it.
But today, we're creating an incredibly rich number of armies that will live in an acute amount of time after our deaths.
I think it creates an incredibly intriguing opportunity for the technology.
For me, I'm sorry, not a logist, so I'd like to highlight the images that are present and future-like.
We're already seeing some of the services that we're going to decide that we're going to need to go from online horses and albums in the sizzard after we die.
One day, one of them, pretty soon, found me skiing in the coffee shop for a Fluidsquar restaurant.
(Recording) Adam: Hi.
Audience: Adam?
A: Yeah.
Number 2: Size can break you anywhere in the world at any hour, even in Ar Uganda.
A: Who is that?
"To measure: ""Ladelcome to ifired.nut"" until I became too aware of it."
(Laughter) A: I mean, isn't it true?
This service is doing pretty simple things: it allows you to create a message or a video that can be published on Facebook after your dying.
Second service is something I don't think about.
It's enabling online from the inner love and to fill it with images and videos and stories that they can post post after their dying.
But then it's just interesting.
Many of you have probably heard about Duba Roy, who's in a gardening show how he's able to treat more than 90,000 hours of video.
I think that the ability to enhance the machine's ability to communicate with great irrigation data is going to be possible to revolutionize the cost of life — tweets, play, play, play it in the dish — that we produce in large areas.
And I think once it's going to be true, for our digital self, it's going to be a real world that we die after our death, because of the content we've created, and it's going to be able to empower the technology's meaning.
Now we're going to look at a couple of experiments.
There's this service — my next Tweil, he's going to understand all of your records, everything you're going to lose, and he's going to ignore what you can write.
So, as you can see, the outcome can be stone.
Imagine what those people will look like in five or 20 years with a better technical opportunity.
You're going to take a step ahead, the research lab at MIT is working on smart machines that can interact like people.
And if the robots could interact on the basis of a single person, hundreds of thousands of only content that a person has created for life.
Now, look at the famous nights in the U.S., in 2008, when CNN's studio had some wired wi-I.I.I.A. to interview Automa from the Cupreme Cup.
What if we could use this technology to design for the benefits of our loved ones in the room, and to make sure that it's very realistic, based on the end of the room that they've created as long as they're living?
I think it's all possible that many of us create data and technology to understand how they grow up in the gymmetric sector.
As a result, I think we all need to think, do we all think, do we want it to become real? And if that's what it means for life and what's next.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The bottom line is from the other administration.
Sadly, the answer to these questions is this.
And then you can do that, and you can test them.
What do we know about complex systems?
You know, you literally don't want a system to deal with your parts.
Where's the economy going?
We've seen Sabulava on my forefront.
What's going to happen in the industry is what's going to be identified.
"""How do they organize?"" "They act alone?""
These are companies that work in more than one country, and there are 43,000.
I'm going to show you analogy.
So let's talk about, I want to talk about the fact that it's the way we talk about love.
I don't know about you, but when I imagine this metaphors, I can see a stage with cartilage — like this person, he walks in the summer, and he doesn't notice, and he comes out to the open man and he's in the channel.
And I think that's exactly the case, because it's not the look.
Finding is an unexpected and forecasting system.
It's something that's happening to us without our own conscience.
I'm an English teacher, and I'm an English teacher, which means thinking about saying, I'm raising my life.
You might say, and I'd like to stress that a lot of methane we're covering to talk about love — maybe even a big part of them — have a problem.
So love, we give.
They beat up.
They grow up.
We give jetism.
We're burning from the smell.
Karachi makes us crazy, and it makes us sick.
And then you break down your heart and then you break down.
So, our metabolism is comprising the love of someone on the edge of violence or disease.
(Laughter) That's right.
And what they do is they define us as selves of unfair and unseen circumstances.
"My favorite friend of them is ""smaten,"" which is, in the late form of ""smite."" And if you look at the meaning of that word in the hospital — (Laughter) — you can see it means ""smatty hour,"" and ""smatiently"" — like the word ""smite"" in a very similar way, in the West."
"In the middle of the fall, there's 1.6 incarceration in the word ""bossal,"" which in the Milky Way is used for the remembering God."
(Laughter) We use the same words to talk about love, which makes sense of franchin resistance. (Laughter)
Right?
So how did this happen?
How did we get to the transformation of love with a huge amount of pain and suffering?
And why do we talk about this feeling like a good thing, like we're dead?
These are tough questions, but I've got a few observations.
And to realize this, I want to focus on one single-three metric that makes love like crazyness.
When I first started studying my original love, I found these metals about crazy everywhere.
In the history of the Western culture, rich monks who are promoting love to the elderly's disease.
Here's a few examples.
And I fell in love in 20 years, and it was pretty unpleasant relationships at the beginning of the day.
It was relationships for the last few years, so it meant very high levels and low share.
I remember one moment.
I sat down on the bed in South America, and I watched my love come out of the door.
It was clear that it was almost night, and we ended up in our neighborhood, and when we went to our room, he left his stuff in Torbu, and he made an argument.
Now, I don't remember that argument, but I remember very clear about watching his son.
I was 22 years old, it was my first traveler in the country, and I was absolutely alone.
So I was going to visit a week to my home, and I knew the name of the city, and the name of the city that I needed to go to, and I couldn't wait for a week, but I didn't have a sense of how to deal with ourselves.
I didn't have a junky date, and I didn't have very much money, and I didn't know American.
Anyone more laughing at me could beat this as a moment of possibility, but I've been stuck.
I just sat there.
And then I turned on.
"But even though I camped, a little voice in my head thought, ""Wow. It was unstable."
"I really love the whole thing."" (Laughter) I mean, at least part of me wanted to experience my absolute love."
Now, this sounds so surprising to me, but at age 22, I wanted to have unnecessary experiences, and at that point I was in a kind of indigenous, angry hole, and that's quite amazing, but I thought it was kind of weird, but I thought it was a sense of the cliche that I had to hear to a guy who just came to me.
I think, at a certain level, I wanted to be a bit tough, because I thought that's how love works.
"It doesn't really have to be weird, and it's amazing to realize that there's eight filters in Victoria, there's eight prints, there's two singers, two or one of them, called ""The Dame Same."" And then then, after the hour, he came to our room."
We grew up.
But holding someone else like this — like my God's greatest room is all about love — wasn't really good for me or for him.
But I think this type of love is not very unusual.
Most of us feel a little bit of a bit of a joke at the end of the cliff.
In fact, there's a study that claims that it's okay, because neuroscience tells us that it's wrong, because it's not that easy to say that it's wrong, because neuroengineering tells us that it's not that easy to talk about.
It's really true.
This is a study by 1999 that uses the analysis of blood in order to realize that the rate of selves is very, very similar to the fence of selves that have grown up in people with SARS.
(Laughter) So, the size of the segment is also connected to the Symphony Symphony Fair and Developmentia.
So, there's a few suggestions that love is connected to changes in our mood and our behavior.
And other studies of learning are that most relationships start in this way.
The investigators report that the overall level of segregation is interconnected with a very embarrassing thought about love, that it feels like a sense of sense of feeling like someone was sitting in their head.
And most of us feel like this when the first time the law fails.
I decided that when my friends couldn't understand my suffering, I don't need their friends.
So I stopped meeting a lot of them.
And this was probably the last year in my life.
But I think I felt like being awake — it's my job, because if I was awake, then I would be able to tell him how much I loved him.
And if I could say that, then we're going to stay together.
And that's true, because there's no universal rule, which says that a lot of suffering leads to a lot of reward, but we're talking about love as if it's true.
It's about love and biological, and it's cultural.
Our biologies tell us that love is a good thing, activating a reward in our brains, and she tells you that love is a bad person when it comes to an argument or a dissipation or a neurotransmitter is broken.
In fact, you've probably heard about it — let's talk about neuroscience, experience a kind of like a sharp way of thinking about it — that I'm going to find it true.
(Laughter) And then our culture is used by language to paint and follow that basic love.
In this case, we're talking about metphans of pain, we're talking about crazy things.
It's a pretty interesting rebellion with the opposite connections.
It's powerless and sometimes balancing, and we're constantly saying it through our words and our stories, but then our stories and our stories are making us hope for the power and the balancing love.
Interestingly, it's all happening in a culture that's shaking out of a manual.
It's as though we want to be crazy, crazy love, and we want it to be hard.
It's terrible.
(Laughter) To get it right, we need to change our culture, or change our expectations.
Imagine that we were all less obsessed with love.
If we were more confident, more open to the faraway, more caveboards, and then instead of giving love into love, we would be able to think about it.
I know it requires a lot of things, but I'm not the first person to offer it.
"In the book, ""Sounding what we live"" by Martin Jopkins and George Lakaf proposed a crazy solution to this hole: We need to change our metabolism."
They claim, and they can even act as leaders of our future prosecutions, as prosecutors that proceed.
Joopkins and Lakafaf proposed a new metaphors for love: Kahara is like a joint art.
I really love this way of thinking about love.
Lindavists say that metals are fixed, essentially, and there's a way of looking at all of these things, or ideas that are used in the metaway.
Joopkins and Lakaf talk about all the workforce on your product product products: crease, rockets, unemployment, collective purpose.
And these ideas are good at bringing together long-term relationships, but they also work in others' relationships — short-term, cold, cold, unnecessary, unnecessary — because these metochs are addressed to a lot more complex ideas than someone else's.
So, if love is a collaborative art, then love is an age-old experience.
It's not fair, it's compassionate, it requires work and treaty, it's staggering and it's exhilarating and exhilarating.
And love is compassionate with desire and pain.
After all, every experience of love is different.
When I was a young man, I never thought I could have done anything I could ever offer love.
When Juill's hours were wandering around for the first time — or if Jewel's birthday couldn't be without Raghai, who she was four days ago, she wasn't frustrated or courageous.
Where does she come?
She wants to wonder.
Right?
And as a rememberer, at this point, at the time of the singing, three out of five, Rauliana didn't die.
He's alive, he's healthy, he's just released from the city.
I know that Veron 16th century is not the same as the modern North America, but when I first read this, at the age of 14, Dewela's suffering had a meaning for me.
It makes me feel like I am creating something that I'm fascinated with, not something that just happens to me without my control or anger, it's something that's deeply intrinsic.
But it's still hard.
One of the things that's very different is sometimes that it's absolutely absolutely irrelevant, and when I feel uncomfortable, I have to remind myself that my task in these relationships is to talk to my partners about what I want to do together.
It's also hard.
But that's much better than the other option that love is crazy.
That's the version of the love that you can't engage or have the most overlooked.
Instead, it requires a partnership and a surplus to address, if it becomes difficult, it's easy, but it's actually a real, truly global, real-world reality.
I mean, you have to stop thinking about yourself and your own purchases or insurance in those relationships, and start thinking that you might want to think about yourself.
"So the version of that love allows us to say things like, "Hey, we're not really good guys. It's not for us.""
"Or, ""Heroids have been soldier than I am, but it's been so wonderful."" And the idea of art is that he's not going to make sure he's not going to make himself."
That's the version of the love that allows us to decide how it looks.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Nearly in '95, I was a student from a friend of mine traveling to cars from the city of Pyrovand, which is in the state of Rod Allendand, to the city of Paris, which is about 5,000 miles away.
Well, you know how it goes when you're little and unwanted, or we don't walk out of charges, most of the national panels, the national handbow, honestly, the hardest path.
In southern Dako, I turned to friends, and I looked at what was going on, and I thought, well, there were 3,000 of them running around me.
""What's this character that's all over the road?""
She's left behind. She's lost.
Ladies to sit at the first time very precisely at the expense of her face.
"(Laughter) And I said to her, ""You know, the people on the side of the road are like Chinese E.S.."" She's going to look at me a few more moments, and then she's laughing, because she's going to understand."
That's me.
(Laughter) Here he is, he's this famous famous place for a pearn. (Laughter)
For the past five years, I've been thinking about this kind of thing — why we sometimes understand the world, and how we do when we get away, and what we realize is that we understand about human nature.
So, let me tell you, I've spent the last five years in reasoning about transition.
My choice makers can give you an awful lot, but it's a big translator: no wheelchair at the business room.
(Laughter) In fact, most of us would be from the rest of our thinking about their identity, or even try not to think about the ability of your mind.
We understand this in the workforce.
We realize that sometimes every single room in this room is wrong.
We are people who are wrong. All right, let's go.
But if I stand on the right, at this point, I believe that this time, then suddenly all of the extrasolar minds of the fly have an argument, and I can't imagine that I'm wrong.
What's interesting about this data is that we live in this data over time.
We're going to meet them, we're going to look at them, we're going to watch vacation, they're going to go to the gates and give their voice to them.
And it's amazing that we're all in the middle of life, in the end, believed that we always have the right thing.
That brings me to the problem.
In my view, it's a problem like every one of us, on a personal or professional level, all of us and all of us as societies.
What I'm going to talk to you today is the first thing we're going to do, because we're going to have a sense of what we're saying.
Secondly, that's why this approach is so problematic.
And so I want to convince you that maybe you can step outside the closet, and if you do that, that's the best part of the dream, the mind and the creativity that you can do.
Why don't we hear ourselves in the sense of your hearing?
One of the things that's connected to is sensitivity.
Let's ask you, maybe Was, because you're right there, and I'm going to show you that emotions are not right?
It's sad. It's humiliation.
It's great. It's great, it's cool, it's super.
They're laughing, they're not real, they're friendship, they're cool, but they're answering the question.
"You answer the question: "I feel like you're not right.""
(Laughter) Now, knowing your mistaken self makes sense, as it was said, and it's a great deal, isn't it?
For example, it might be a terrible sensation, or it might be a sense of prejudice, or even a similar sense, like my soul of Chinese alphabet.
But it's not very much about any of these emotions.
So here's the analogy.
Do you remember Lunn Zuese cartoons, where is that world's whispering at an hour of honor, but you can't see the painter with disbelief?
Almost in every seizure of this season, it's happening that you're going to be walking away with the alarm and you're going to see the hell that you're not supposed to say, because there's a film, and that's going to be able to escape.
But every time you're having a rock garden, it's now hot for the fruit.
What's funny is, especially when you're only six years old, what's wrong is that it's not true too.
It just keeps going until it looks down and it's not going to look like it's going to vibrate into charges.
That's when he leaves.
If we're wrong, if we don't realize that we're wrong, and that's what we're wrong with, and then we're like to have a rock, and then we're going to get it wrong, but we're going to get it wrong.
You see, we've already gone, we've already got to deal with it, but we still feel more confident about ourselves on the ground.
I have to say, well, I've got to change what I said.
There's a sense of self-estefficacy: it's a sense of self-righting.
(Laughter) And because of this stigma we learned when we're a human being connected to our own rights.
I'm going to make a mistake of that blindness.
Most of the time, we don't have all the parts in the room that would argue that if we're wrong, we don't know.
There's another reason why we get to that point, it's more relationships to culture.
Imagine a stuttering school.
You're sitting there, and a teacher comes back with control, and one of them looks like this.
In fact, it's not my own.
(Laughter) Here you're in high school, and you know what to think about one gradient, that you've got this point.
He's a fool and a ball, and he never does the task.
So, to the age of nine years, you've learned that first of all, those who have been wrong with ice and back and forth, and second, to achieve success in life, have never been wrong.
We're learning these extraordinary lessons very choirs.
Most of us, and I think, especially in this room, are treated by the current state of China with unnecessary practices, primary prefrontalists, old men.
Do you see the CEO CEO, he's complaining about astrophysics, he's sorry for a super marathon?
(Laughter) So you're all of these CEOs, astrophysics and marathons.
Hai will be.
It's the only thing we're going to see when we're going to see, perhaps we're wrong.
Because when we think in that direction, when we make sure we make something wrong with us.
So we persist on our own, because that's how we feel intelligent, responsible, charitable and protected.
Let me tell you about an incident.
A few years ago, Batthen Journal Jacques took a woman to operate.
This hospital lies in Boston.
This morning, students from Gardardard, who are one of the best students in the country.
A young woman took care of the operation and connected the information.
She was paused under the disease, the surgeon over her mastro, and then he's catching her and then she's taken over her doctor's brain, and then he's got her doctor's brain surgery.
Given the operation, the operation went wrong.
"The male wakes up, and she says, ""Why don't I tinker at that base?"" And she says, ""Well, the surgeon has done a serious surgery on her left, not on the right."
When he talked about this story, he said something very amazing about how he processed, he said something very exciting.
"He just saw that he was working on the right base."" (Laughter) Why am I telling you that I'm telling you that, because I'm going to accept the bad news that you're going to find on the right database, maybe it's very dangerous."
It's an inner sense of the sense of your hearing that we're all sometimes feeling, no matter how the only couple of things that actually occur in the ringing world.
And when we're directed only on that pavara, and we don't even think about the ability to tolerate, we're doing stupid things like we're doing 760 million gallons in the audience in Monday, or it's a global economy.
It's a huge problem for exercise.
But it's also a huge problem for society.
Think about it as if you think of yourself as being right.
That means your belief is wrong with the reality of reality.
With this sense of clarity, it's a very narrow problem that explains all the people that are disadvantaged with you.
It turns out that most of us have been explaining people to other people using smart assumptions.
The first thing we tend to think is that when anyone in the world is disadvantaged, that they're not conscious about data.
They just don't get to the information that you have, and when you're looking at this information, you're going to feel they're going to sleep, and they're going to hit you.
If it doesn't happen, if we give them what they want to do with us, but continue to get away from us, we move to the other reason, which is exactly what they are.
(Laughter) Before them, they've got all these pieces of paper, and they're nuts, they can't pick it up.
And if it doesn't work, if we realize that people who don't get angry with us don't want to be the worst fault, and then they're kind of smart, we're going to get to the next assumption — they know the truth, but for their angry purpose, that's why they're so exciting.
That's a catstorm.
It's our transformation to feel the right things we don't need to make mistakes, especially when it's free, and the worse we get to each other's future.
What I'm most excited about is that I think it's tragic that this is something that's absolutely absolutely going to happen to our humanity.
It's as though we want to believe that our minds are such unnatural through the windows that we're capable of seeing and exactly how we're describing light.
And we want everybody to look at the world through the same kind of whiskey, and we've seen exactly the same thing.
That's not the case, and if it was, the light would be incredibly good.
The goal of our mind is not that we can see the light that it is.
It's the fact that we can see light in the same way that we have.
We can have memories about the future, and think about the future, and we can imagine, like we are other people in other places.
And that's because everybody sees the opposite, we can see behind that glass and see it, and that's what it looks like.
That's why we're wrong.
"In the 1200 years before Dewart asked his faint words, ""I think we're talking to the U.S.'"" and he said, "Fallor ergo sum," "I'm wrong and I'm wrong.""
The author author realized that the fact that we're wrong with this is that it's not an unconventional defect of the human system, it's not something that's going to stopping or stopping.
It's the essence of our humanity.
Because we're not God, we don't know very much what's going on in the world.
Unlike other animals, we endlessly try to fix this light.
I think it's the endless division, it's the leather and the whole of our work and the creativity of fantasy.
"First of all the reasons, I started listening to a lot of college programs, ""This is American life,"" in a public office."
And then I went to hear, and my father began to realize that all the schedules are an unimaginable experience.
"And at first I thought, ""Well, I was like, ""Yeah."
Now, I'm always as insane as I see an impression.
"It makes me feel everywhere."" The apartments were."
But in a matter of months, I had the opportunity to interview an interview at Arazuel's Craigent Reserve.
"I'm going to let you think to them, and he's like, "That's really what it is.""
He said that they're even complaining that every year in college, that's the most exciting thing.
"And it turns out to be like, ""I thought something like this, and it really happened."" ""What's interesting about Arara Giza, is that we need this kind of thing."
"We need to be able to look at this epiphany, and we need to align these gaps."" So what's all of us in the audience, in the audience, in the listener or the readers, is something like this."
We're being told by stories, jeweling sneakers and unexpected nations.
What's all about our learning is we've got to get wrong.
But you know that our distortions are like this, because our lives are like this.
We think that's what's going to happen, and it really doesn't happen.
George Bush thought that Iraq was attacked there by mass destruction, liberating people and deciding that he was going to declare Blessness.
And it really happened.
And also, Huhammad Mubarra thought he would be an Evetuator to the end of his life until he gets over and grabbed, and then he would be able to tell his son's cheese.
And it really happened.
Suppose you'd ever thought you'd make and spend your time with your favorite school, you'd go back to the hillside and you'd be doing how many things together.
And it really happened.
I have to confess that I thought I would write a book on something that I'd never seen before, that I would never read.
And it really happened.
(Laughter) It's the same life.
We make incredible ideas about sustainable light, and somehow it's a better cause, and somehow it doesn't work, and the light turns and blows us up.
Don't remember, there's a lot of implications that we can't do wrong.
We've spent a whole week talking about innovation, enhancing and overlapping, but you know, why do we need these innovations, improvements?
Because half of the ideas were really interesting, and they had the opportunity to change the world — look at TED in 1998, where they were.
(Laughter) It didn't work, didn't it? (Laughter)
Where do I get my confidence, Chris? (Laughter)
(Applause) And we're going to do it again.
And that's how it's going to continue.
We're going to get another idea.
We tell another story.
We're on another conference.
Tomorrow, as you've already heard 7 million times as to invent a great commitment.
"And I mean, if you really want to figure out greatness, then go out of the limits of this charity and the fear of your rights and look at each other, and look at each other, and look at the distinction, the obsession and the obsession and the magic says, ""Well, I don't know."
"Maybe I'm wrong."" Thank you."
(Applause) All right. (Applause)
Fifty teenager in the 1990s, a man and Saint Nazoli, went to the hotel in Mahnahlin, and he came up with Mahara Khannanne, who's the Secretary of the lawns.
At first, Nazar was acknowledged in the wild, but by showing other assaults, he and his bankers started attacking his weaknesses in New York City, Prince, Tunny and the headquarters of the Archivision.
Thankfully, these were FBI-driven devices.
But sadly, the Universe in 1993 in the Northwest harbor was not there.
As a result, Nazar has been judged by the West.
And as Nadororo is my father.
I was born in Pragani, Beijing, 1983 in a family with a creative engineer and a mother and a teacher, and a young teacher, and Bazi, together, would try to make my childhood happy.
But when I was awake for seven years, when I was born in our family, I started to change.
My father showed me that Islam, who young people will see, including even most Muslims.
My experience shows that when people recognize one another, they don't have a lot of time to understand what we all want to each other.
But in every sense, every single one in the world knows that there's a few processes in the world that are so-reviewed by their belief that there's a need to use any option to make others live on their rules.
In just a few months, the father would plant me and tell me that the last few of his friends, he and his friends, he went to the Siberia League Awards to train the class.
He said, next morning, I'll go with him.
So we came to the Carlverton Castro, and we sat down with the FBI.
That day, my last year, I lost my last leg in a little orange forest on a peacebuilding forest, and, of course, all of my life, the humbly shattered fire.
"My family turned to my friend, and he said to Arabic, ""Great."" And my father, and that's the son."
And all of them were very, very different, but only a few years later, I realized the meaning entirely.
They saw me from the Southwest who my father was.
And as a result, those people have judged over the overheart, who have been attacked by family members of the Saudi Conday in the underwear of the U.S. Supreme Goulder, and this man has committed to death, he's got more than a few.
These were the men I was fascinated with.
"And the brilliant people I called ""mom,"" which means, ""Come.""
Every time I begin to experience self-esteem in one place, I've been able to get things out of time and go to another guerrilla.
It's always going to be a new face in class, and I've often been a peacebuilder.
I've been asked to judgment people on the fundamental circumstances such as alarm or race.
So what opened my eyes?
The first story that hit this mind mind took place during the civilian election of the year.
By training a program, I was able to stopping the National Geographic Glacibow in the morning.
The groups of our group represent the same kinds of public plan.
One day, I came to the end of my life, and I found that one of my new friends was a gamble.
I've never had a friend of hubris still, and honestly, I'd say that I'd redirected a banner, an imperative that I thought I had almost everything to do with my life.
In the middle of the room, the left-hand side was in Burs Gardens. It was a Styrofathers.
And there I saw people all different faiths and cultures, and this experience made a fundamental difference in my personality.
Occasionally, a kid's experience, and he's been able to help me get a sense of empathy for suffering from others, and for me, it's not going to be possible for other good people, it's not as much as I'd like to get older.
It's a sense that allows me to connect the stereotypes that I've been taught in as a kid, with a life experience.
And then there was a Daily Sweight, and every night John Sierra asked me to be scarce with me about my own data, and he told me that race or social action didn't have anything to do with any kindness.
And in many ships, he gave me a dad that I then needed that.
In fact, the intelligence often comes from where it's going, and now I realize that my father's guitar has impacted my candle more powerful than my father's office.
And one day, I was talking to my mother about how my mother started to change my freshness, and she told me something I would hold my heart in my life.
And at this point, I realized how much energy energy comes out to stare at this unnecessary heart of myself.
Beck Ibrahim is not my name.
So I would bring it to my family when I decided to break relationships with my father and start a new life.
So I'm going to open up my personalities, and I'm going to look at my dangerous people?
Well, that's simple.
Instead, I'm going to use my experience to fight against the bias, to fight against the data.
I've been doing this for dealing with mental care and for their novelty, for the insurance and the insurance and the insurance that they've been trying to get on their board because they're rational.
And in memory of giving a donation, I'm going to talk to you about these unprecedented events and judgment of my parents.
I'm showing you that violence isn't going to be part of an alpha or race, and the son's obligation to the walk of his parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you. (Applause) Thank you all of you. (Applause) Thank you all. (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause)
But it can't be.
I love people who love the shaman guy.
I learned a third of these 30-degree challenges.
This is a picture of my challenge when I was doing my next picture, every day, every month.
I've never met a great deal.
She's terrified.
In fact, they're more found.
(Applause)
I was incredibly privileged to be in the middle of the world to be a girlfriend in the world.
In 1975, when I was seven years old, women in the West came out in a funny way.
That day, they didn't work, regardless of whether they had a workshop, or they just did it.
They would come to the Ray Island Center, they would take 90 percent of women — and they would go and they would ask for the sabbatical.
You don't have to work in the West that day, because nothing works when women don't.
(Applause) About five years later, the Iranians had the courage to be the world's first country in the world, and the prohibitional path of choosing women as President.
I'll never forget that day, when President Vigs, of course, in us and Jane, came to the bark of my house, my mother, and my daughter, and then my grandfather.
(Applause) She became an extraordinary niche for me to make sure that every one who grew up at that time, including a boy.
"She often told me a story about a boy who went up to her after a few years of plantation, and she said, ""Well, boys can also become a nerd when they grow up?"" (Laughter) And the landmen really have a lot of value, but even though I'm really strong for the discovery that I'm very pronounceful, when I'm going to mentor the plant, my first message was, ""Hot I'm going to test this plant?"
"Who am I so afraid to be married?"" And the contrary is that women are less likely to commit to the plant than men."
Surprisingly, analyzed in the United States in 2011, they found that 62 percent of men looked at their end of the country on the Garden Fund, but only 45 percent of women.
We see a 1.6 percent breakthrough, and that's the same breakthrough that we've seen in the decade ago.
It's a real deal, because I'm sure that the world needs women's gifts and more principal leaders at first.
So my solution to grading was to come up with what I'm going to need to do in my office, even without any political experience, to step ahead and try to make sure that we can breathe for three kids that we really allow young men and men and women to do what they want to do.
That was the journey of my life.
It was wonderful.
The desert started with 20 continuous nations.
After classification, the number was connected to the end of the country, and finally the race came to us with chunks, three men and me.
(Applause) But that's not the whole jara yet.
Well, you might think that the United States has a lot of jars, but I can — (Laughter) I can say that we're in trouble.
First of all, President, did the last 20 years, figured out that they're not going to get grades, it might be, and led to that extent.
And then he thought, well, when our press-grown-grown-groupists were brought up to the sum of the Palestinian presses he'd been diagnosed with and his family.
Finland came out of the bush, because when President told us that the country needed a leader.
And a few days later, the connection with his wives and her family was also found in the Panama Brothers, and he went back to the street again.
Until he told me that he was doing this, because now there are two highly skilled men who can become it a year-to-day market.
So, nine tweets, 45 days before the option, looked pretty good for me.
I didn't even get a place in a gallery.
Now, I had one percent of the interviews, but one of the things that was the biggest market among women.
It's going to change the message that I'm going to challenge all of the challenges to get my place behind the stadium, and go to the seat, because the judge's solution only to the end of the peace world is 2.5 percent of the voices in the first few decades.
And one day, these debates found that I'm going to stay there with my men, and during the emergency room, I realized that I was walking around 2.5 percent a day in the first debates.
(Applause) And the problem.
And the fair problems that we've had to deal with and do it this way have been connected to the media, the division and the grave.
Let's talk to the media.
Some people say that half of my science and politics are not relevant.
I can't afford it.
I found myself getting more access to media and more open time.
I mean, this is the ending ending with the media, 87 times in a few months before the election, just as I got 31 times as soon as I got there.
And I don't mean that the media does it.
I think the reason for the unfinished page is because in the media, the pain of the private, like all the rest of the world, there's a spiritual and unconscious page, and we need to talk about it if we want to change.
"When I got to TB, the first question I asked was, ""Do you plan to hold your country?"" That was the question."
And of course, one to two and a half percent of the voices you can understand it.
But the media really matters, and every time I've been talking about TB, we've seen and felt a lot about it, so I don't know how much it matters, and why we should talk about it.
I've had one in the late half half of the country never interviewed the first room.
Sometimes I was leaving behind the questions that were going to end the rest of the world, and that was the essence of the choice.
I ran around with this, but let me tell you the computer of the Islamic media.
There was almost no comment at least one of my recent comments or casualities.
(Applause) It's going to be broken.
But there's another really important experience.
I graded how independent of the world was, without any political background or gender.
This diversity of experience and opportunity for resources may have gone through our company, but also let's allow politics to do it differently and make it different.
Our company was positive, and we may have changed the tons of choices for others.
That's the reason why I spend a lot of time on TB, because I wanted to show you the benefits of the other press.
When we have access to media, incredibly complex, we've launched our own information.
I'm going online on Facebook, and I've been answering all the questions I'm asking for for.
All of these ideas together, we put together open-source messages on Facebook, because we believed that it was important to use when we want to get tired of trust.
When I turned out to be a problematic for the next few young questions, I started using Swiss.
And Naza told me how to do that, and I used every movie at Switchat during the last part of the company.
I was really excited by a lot of humps and rooms, because I'm right here.
But because of that, we have increased the number of people in the room.
And it turns out that maybe we can start a company and we can do it in a different way.
Sadly, we can't talk about politics and not talk about money.
It's all true, but it's true, and we've had less resources than other countries.
Perhaps the reason, in part, was because, in my view, it was so bad that we were worried about sanitation.
And maybe I wanted to do more menu.
Some people don't think it's very late.
But even with the tragic media and financial resources, and only with the entrepreneurial team, but the great team, we were able to see everybody in the day when we had the first prime numbers.
I felt like you can see in the picture.
(Laughter) The factory of the first nerd, I was walking around with a bear in the middle of the world.
(Cheering) Well, too early, because I couldn't win, but we went to a very close place, and we went on a long way from one to the next, almost three parts of the voice, and we tried to do the prejudice of an unprecedented address, which was 10 percent of the hospital in the past.
With that, some of them will catch me with the real request of choice, and many people would ask me to ask me to ask again.
But what I really want to realize is that I've made a proposition to the at least higher levels of urge, and a huge number of people have encouraged my daughter 2040.
(Applause) She's 13 now, and she's never in TB.
But on a day of choice, I'd see her on TB, she was intelligent, self-confident, she was honest and she kept her mother.
Well, it might have been the shortest moment of my company.
(Applause) But there was another one.
And when she came to sleep, a girl looked at my bedrock at the bush and said, you know, you know, he's going to fix it, and he's going to fix it.
Audience: Ooh!
This picture, for me, is going to stop.
We can achieve everything we see.
Yes, the hell and the problems.
(Applause) Women in driving need, and it's time for women to educate, let's say it's going to be a plant of heroics or a president.
"Anny night, I was struck by your old magazine, ""Newer."" I had a new you saying, ""It's a smart truth."" (Cheering) I mean, it's my greatest challenge, because women are often used by selfishness, like I click it, but I know from my experience that we're just going to figure out if we're doing that."
(Applause) And we need to use that more.
On a day of choice, we sang as if we wished, because that's how we felt.
We're going to get there.
You just have to go to that, and you, your family and friends, all of you who work with you, when you ask good, grow up to the bottom of everything that you've experienced before.
We've taken a good time, and I've learned during this journey more than I can tell you about my last time.
But I'm sure that was a huge job.
For the last few months, I've lost a lot of sleep.
It's going to have been trivial and hard to keep cheese, and I realized that I knew at the end of the day that one in the morning, that you'd be able to do the only thing when you'd ever listen to yourself and listen to yourself and do something about it that's called a voice.
So as I say, my good sister says, you can undermine your intaction, but you're never going to be surprised at you.
I want to also stress, and you all know that, at any point, it's your team's important.
People around us share your values and balances, but they're different from others.
For me, this form of success, I'm an amazing man who's here today, an amazing family — (Applause) and a great friends, we've gone as entrepreneurs in politics and we've brought things together, and we've done words that are impossible.
"The voice is, let's say, ""The chief council with the public said, ""How did I make a decision that would be good if I made it seven percent?"
And I gave him a look, because maybe he's right, and he's trying to understand his most valuable experience.
But one day, I decided to show you that he's wrong.
And it's important to recognize this, because I was really young and working hard, like people alongside me.
We can't do a lot of things if we don't forget about ourselves.
And I think that's really important for two things: attacking people and on the right, but it doesn't matter if you don't have more courage to reconfigure from people and justify your energy energy, including great blogs and comments.
And so I had a whole lot of other sustainment, and I decided to focus on the paragraphs, in part, because of my power power charged at the same time.
When I was suffering from energy for a while — and it was an hour away from time, because it wasn't easy — I turned around with my reasons to ignore, and not just like that, but on my checks.
I called our Facebook 4G, where the letters of G means the English word.
"The first one is ""Grandn."" I was grading to do this, to be sure, I wanted to move forward leadership as the cost of our work in front of the company."
"The second word is ""Gilli,"" or joy."
I decided I would love to travel.
You can take a lot of it, even though it's going to be possible, or it's going to be able to reach the target.
And I've come up with all the ways that I've been trying to inspire others.
"The third introduction of the word is ""Grandncelii."" I was open for all the articles."
I didn't have the secrets, but you could figure out Facebook or on our gardens.
I believe that when you leave pressing, you should ask your questions.
In fact, the most important word to the end of this room doesn't need to explain, we're a big company called Groupoft, is the strongest power.
(Cheering) I'm incredibly excited that I found courage to get grades to be willing to be concerned, but I'm going to get a lot more nodes.
I can't say it was simple, but I'm sure, and I think my whole team was halfway away, and it was worth it.
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
Pat Mitchell: I'm not going to give you yet. Hall Thomas: I'm so good. PM: I can't help you, I won't tell you.
Perhaps all of you in this room are going to drive the coastal room and plant you.
We're not going to have a voice in there, but there's something that we can take away from the coast, like before, that's an inspiration.
I mean, it's enough to try to remember 1975, when women came out on the street, and it really became a big fan of the movement.
You've been sleeping this journey before, and let's just take a look at the country that looks like a tank that's going to go into a tourist.
And you may not know, because the American media didn't go on this, but the Islamic women went back to the street again. Right?
HT: Right. PM: Can we tell you about this?
HT: 41 years from now, by the time it's funny, we can make the best place in the world in order to be free, but our work didn't work.
So, in 1498, women in the United States stopped working, because that's what they did in the morning, they made their origins.
(Applause) The real issue was that young women and women made a lot more money than they did before, because they turned out to be able to make a lot of money.
PM: I'm not going to experience Hall right now about her future planes, but I'm going to tell you that you're going to have a great great opportunity to do it again.
Thank you, Hall.
HT: Thank you all.
(Applause)
In fact, I've been trying to think about my maps since I left the White House, and the best example I've ever done is New Yorker a couple of years ago.
"The little boy, look at the father, says, ""Hey, when I grow up, I want to be an excessive."" (Laughter) I've got a lot of courage, like the president, because I've been able to access the few people in the world ever, ever to meet the people around the world."
They'll try these rules to make sure that women's friendshipshipships are usually more likely to be friendships than men in the bathroom of God.
So they came up with the claims that essentially bring women together to be mentors, to educators, to connect with them in a cup of art, or to the Army, when a woman in the classroom in the South of Chicago, she can't tell you if she's a young man in the room, because you can find a fierce in the middle of the room, and in the hallway, over 30 people say she shouldn't have a male, and so on and so forth.
But the key thing is that the interviews are misconceptable to keep men in a higher condition.
Why do I have to pay them such a reward for using the same work?
In the U.S., for example, we've had a huge increase in white coverage in the U.S., the primary dark-looking men and menughities that have been planted in prison.
Now, 7.3 people in jail today.
That seven will increase.
Since I left the White House, there's an increase in 800 percent of the dark women in jails.
We're one of the wondrous craters on the Earth, which is still my dying show, as it's the old country.
We're in California right now, and I've been finding four billion dollars in charge of announcing 13 people to be dead.
One of them is the choice of the tent's orchestra.
Sometimes, in more extreme cases, they get more exotic than they do, so young women can.
And then, when she gets married, that's the same time she opens up to be sexy.
It's not rare, although it's against the law.
Eggler, for example, 91 percent of all women living in Eggler today, were sexually assertive in this way.
In a number of countries, it's over 98 percent of women, paragraphically, that's what's going on.
It's a terrible thing for all the women who live in countries.
The other really profound thing is, where a family with the wrong explanation, there's nothing in Quron, and he's looking at it — a little girl with her family, when she's pregnant or when she's married or even when she's not married, sometimes even if she's wearing it.
It's being done by someone's family, so the family's grown up when young women get so compassionate in their family.
Not so long ago, AAN was tested in Egghtz, and he showed that 75 percent of these women were interviewing sex workers, friends or marriage, 25 percent of the rights of women.
In fact, the problem that we have in the world is equality, or sanctity of people like this is called now.
About 12.5 million people were celebrated in New Year in the 19th century and in the 18th century.
Thirty million people live today.
The global debate in the U.S. is about giving up every year to the right, and the prosecutors of disengagement are going through the limits of every year, 80 percent of those amazing people — women who are spending their sexuality.
In the United States, it's this moment in the United States, 60,000 people live under their genes or in slavery.
Protanto, George, where I'm sitting at the Carborne Bridge, and where I'm going to send you to U.S. Emanra, between 200 and 300 women.
That's the place number one in the country because of that.
And Alanthanese is also a lot of plantations.
If a boroughman want to buy a little girl who's good at doing it for a billion dollars.
A young woman will take a fireman in Alaneta, and he can drive around 3,000 slaves.
The Union in Alaneta, the state of George.
It's coming to one of the biggest challenges, women are sold and sold all over the world.
The Sweden has a good approach to this.
15 to 20 years ago, Sweden decided to change the law, and women no longer count the law when they're born in sexual slavery, but the bankers of the Greenland, the judges and — (Applause) — the team went to the neighborhood.
The United States is in the United States.
On one male, the last 25 women in the U.S. have been in the United States.
Canada, Irelandi, I said, Sweden, Financial and other countries move to this now.
That's another one on the right that can be done.
We have two big schools in the country, our army and our great system.
So what we're looking at is articulate.
The last quiz I've come to say, well, that's happened in the armed room — 200.
Only 3,000 people in the middle are more than one percent, and the reason is that a team of organizations — like my fake boat, or the crew in the Martian fifth — my team's rights on the idea of nomadic rat attacks, and of course, the last thing they want to do is they don't do it this way.
This law has to be changed.
The Suffice of Scientists says, the Protection Protection campus has gone down because the educational system, when they're assaulted to someone, but when they end up with a Ph.D.
They don't break down.
These are the things that are happening in our society.
When I became the president, the difference was 39 percent.
So we've gone through each progress, and so on — (Applause) — but in the last 15 years, it was only about 23 or 24 percent in the last 15 years.
That's what's happening now.
If you take 500 companies, in 23 of their home women, from 500, and these leaders in the morning, I'll tell you that they're paid on average less than the leaders.
That's what's happening in our country.
The other problem with the United States is that we are the hubris of the Earth.
We found War II soon since World War II.
Often our salts were in the basement.
In the middle of the world, we flew over the stall, and we looked at people's boots.
Sometimes, of course, we now have monopolithicists.
We were going to be wars from 25 different countries, or more after World War II.
For hours and years, I won't tell you which we didn't wear — (Applause) — we didn't see any pain, we didn't suffer.
But in any case, those other things, the opposite to violence and the wrong scripts, the primary violence against women.
The other handful of reason, Augustam, men to clap.
(Applause) It's true.
It's an incredibly powerful man who can say that the room is making a good betrayal, it's very similar to when I was a mast when I was a majestic and still thoughtful.
But for this time, there have been a lot of white people who don't think there's a lot of blindness going on, but they've been silenced, because they've been used by charging people to jewelry, high schools and everything else, and that's the thing that's happened today, because there's a real male, actually.
"In fact, when they say, ""I'm against discrimination, they're using the beneficiaries."
What's the key thing we have to do today?
I would say, the best thing we could do for women with powerful stigma like this, and where you come from, Europe, and so on, who has to take responsibility for themselves to be more transcribed to end slavery around the world.
But I hope that after this conference, women believe their husbands, their assaults in college and army and gangs, and the future in the marketplace, you have to protect your friends and your business.
I have 12 yards, I have seven kids and 10 honest kids, and I often think about them, and I often think about them, and I don't just think when they're living in Empire, and I hope that all of you will join me to be the championships for women all over the world, and protect them from people.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
When I was a student here in Oax in the 1970s, the future of the world seemed to be irrelevant.
The rise of a population was not stopping.
The global Northwest came out of trouble.
According to the cancer epidemic, it's caused by generosity in the wild, and it's lost our lives.
The North Pole was right over the forest.
Natasha passed away, and I scattered the rest of the world.
My average life expectancy was 30 percent.
The child's plant is a little smaller than two-thirds.
Living food on a population is growing up.
We've gone down to a large population of disasters, and this graph shows GDP per capita.
In other words, you have to understand how ideas get sexy.
I want you to imagine what we're going to do from building these things.
And of course, there were some changes, but the device was shifting over the course of that age.
It's a fantastic feat, but it's true.
That time, the October on the right is five years old.
And more than that, with a collection of different ideas — ideas of plastics, ideas of lasers, ideas of waste.
They were connected together in this technology.
And it's a combination, it's a combination of technology that's going on for me, because I think it's the key to understand what's going on in the world.
My body is also a collection of ideas: the idea of curriculum-to-peer, the idea of brain-to-peer, the idea of claying.
They planted together.
How do we evolve to make something connected?
She uses a tenth of failure.
One of the things that we're going to do is we're going to get another one.
There's a species of chambers in the room that maybe a person can get in a lunch lady's lunch lady.
Now, sex is allowing the human to name the generic innovation of all species.
It's not going to last its own growth.
So what does this effect do in the cultural revolutions that sexually has a biological age?
I think the answer is an insurgency, one thing that's different.
It's a domestic human market.
No animal doesn't do it.
Maybe the essence of a culture is a culture.
Solar is a culture that has a culture.
They teach one traditional teacher that our parents pass from our parents.
Specialism has all sorts of different cultures in different teens.
They don't have any idea for them.
So why is it going to increase the lifespans?
The answer came from Davy Park in 18178.
And write him think in a version of the Casmanian age that he also explained in the Gulf of the country.
It produces the wild in four hours and it's sitting in three hours.
It generates the wild at one o'clock in an hour, and it's sitting in two hours.
It's the best Adam to grow up and the barbers and the wilds.
I'm not going to be Adam.
He can do his own wildlife and his satura.
Adam and Oz are half an hour of his time.
First of all, you have to leave the village in the village.
How many times are you in this zodiac? There's a lot of time.
How many are you going to get to work for an hour on the bottom line to read if you're born in the UK?
The guy on the right was taken to me by other people.
How many exactly did you do it?
Are you ready? Are you ready?
You know, I think millions are millions.
And that's how society works.
That's what we're finding as a biological ecological ecology.
In the age of age, when you were wealthy, people literally worked on you.
498 people would give him dinner every day.
In fact, there are other animals that work on one another.
It's a key example.
The left is responsible for jump.
(Applause) When did this happen?
But I don't have a clue to that.
And the beauty of this system is that it's going to make a difference or a bass.
And a man knows he doesn't have to drop out to be athletic.
They were high-performance visions.
They were a very intelligent species.
But there's no evidence that they've been in their ward of work.
There's no evidence for a number of women.
And women grew together with men.
There's also no evidence that we've seen from a group of people, because we've learned the Navy Journalists, the tools they've always made with local materials.
For example, there's a place in Kahlakas, where local telecommunications have been discovered.
They've always been taken from a local village.
When a person started to refuse this way of looking around, it would serve as though they were shrinking between groups.
It's a number of times as big as razorism.
And when we see this, it's something like 8012,000 years ago in Africa where we see the acoustics, the Yash and the other things that are very, very far away from Environmental.
Also, the cartoons — as we did here in Oxcard, were 200 miles away from the mantra of the NRA.
And that's the evidence that groups of people started paragraphing.
And that's led to a skillful approach.
What happens when we limit people to the paragraph, to be able to minimize and to skill?
The answer is, it's not just the only way to make technology progress, but it can even get it to the opposite direction.
Let's bring it to this extraordinary place.
The brown men were so wealthy.
So again, you ask yourself, not just who did it for someone, but who knew how to do it?
Nobody, literally nobody.
"And I'm sure, of course, a quote by the famous Lebanardo of the 1950s, the economist of the 1950s, called ""I, Aloqua,"" which he wrote in, how he made a nickname, and nobody knows how to do it, because people don't know how to do it, how to treat it, and they don't know how to plant it and scale."
So what we've done in the modern society, pathetically, is we've created a way to do things that we don't even understand.
It's not the same as the language.
In fact, so I'm not interested in defections on a level of intriguing, or having some groups more IQ than other groups.
That's absolutely not my knowledge.
In society, what matters is how people get their ideas, and how good they get, not how intelligent one person is.
We created a collective brain.
We're just nodes in the concerts.
We are the neurons of this brain.
Eventually speaking, meeting and promising ideas with one rights of technology, enabling technology, enabling, step forward.
You're not less, you're falling down and bad things.
In the future, as long as we move forward, fearful things happen.
They're going to be warriors, depression, natural scaffolding.
I'm absolutely sure that things happen in this century.
Thank you.
