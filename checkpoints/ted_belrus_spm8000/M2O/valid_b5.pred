(Cheering) I look to Alaho from Santa, and the name of Alaha, the peacebuilding and peacekeeping.
I was born in middle class.
That's why I was so lucky.
My mother had 1,6 children.
With 1,6 children, only five were still alive.
Imagine what my childhood was like.
What I saw was women who didn't fall down, or children who would go to prayers.
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children.
Unfortunately, my country was not international for the women, and so I was accepted in a vacation, but I couldn't fix it.
And my father asked me to come to America.
I went to America.
I've gone through my education.
And while I was learning, I was in the country walking around the race of the Chinese.
You know, when I was going to college, I didn't even know what happened to my family and my country.
It took months, but I didn't know anything.
My family was in a lavar for a white-grandfather.
As soon as I graduated, I moved my family to America.
I wanted them to live in safety.
Where was my heart?
My heart was in Afghanistan.
I had to get to work.
You're going to get college students.
And so I went to the whiteman's hands.
When I got to that lagar in Paris, I saw 7.5 million whitemen, 7.5 million whitemen.
About 90 percent of them were women and children, most men were hobbled or bathrooms, and you know when I was in the lava of white men.
When I interviewed the interview every day, I discovered things that you can't imagine.
I saw in the middle of the young children who sat down and crying, and she didn't know what to do.
I saw a young woman who couldn't go out, had no education, no fun, who didn't even have a place for life.
It was a very sad time.
At that moment, we're talking about the impulse.
"At that moment, I asked myself, "What can I do for these people?""
How can I help them?
At that moment, I realized that education changed my life.
She changed me, she dared me a status.
And at that point, I realized that I had to give my mother a culture of education and health, and I started working on that.
Do you think I was easy?
Not because at that point, higher education was always fun at the time of Africa.
"And she said, ""I want to do this."" Who am I?"
Or ask me? Of course, not.
That's why I had to build trust in this community.
So how did I do that?
I interviewed, and I looked around, and I found out.
I said it.
It was 80 years old.
He was right.
"And he looked at me and he said, ""Warget, a woman's boy. How can I be a teacher?"" And I said to him, ""I'm going to be a teacher?"" And he said, ""I'm going to be angry with you."" And he said, ""Well, when I started working with him in the news, the news started to tell me."
Almost one year, we had 25 schools, and 15,000 children in these schools have been doing this. It's incredibly powerful.
Of course, we're doing work, we're asking teachers, we're asking for women, we're asking people, we're asking people, we're asking people, we're asking people, we're going to ask them, we're going to ask them, and I'm going to tell you, one day, I'm going to tell you.
I was one day at the office in Beijing, Postistan.
"And all of a sudden, I saw my workmates walk up to rooms, shut the door and say, ""Come on, come up!"" If you were that, what do you do?"
You're mad. You know, it's dangerous.
You know what your life is on.
But as brilliant, you have to be male.
You have to spare and report power.
So I invite them to come up with me.
They came up. They'll go for dinner.
I would invite them to sit down and I would like harmony.
"They refused, said, ""It's not going to be a harmie."
Of course, they're a subtle voice that they're talking to me, and I'm really excited. I'm really going to go.
But I was a strong one, and I kept mutating.
"They said, ""What are you going to do?"
My employees started out in the office.
They've been able to open the clickers.
We've been talking to our mother and children.
Educating compassionate health training.
We conducted all the training that you just can imagine.
I was happily happy. I was fascinated by my work.
One day, we have to take care, one teacher, and I went to the night of Kabul, and then suddenly we were stopped by traffic jars in the south.
They pasted us on beaches, and they pasted us.
This time we're all over here.
Let's say where you're going.
If you walk to your home, nobody remained.
I had just been a gift. I lost my voice.
They came to hundreds of women to get education.
So, I sat there and suddenly — in this moment, we're talking about jaw — at this point, at this point, one of my great donors on the right-hand side.
"And she asked me, ""Are you talking?"" I asked her."
Today, these people are going to be good.
And — (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
It's a demonstration that education increases people.
I live in a country that was absolutely beautiful and good.
I just want to share with you.
We could tell where we wanted to go.
Do you know what happened to my country?
Today, people can't walk out of their homes, they don't care about safety.
But we want to go back to the page of the Seviathan.
They get holes and they learn from law enforcement.
He said that compassion and love can be built up by the universe.
Sir-firector: What do you want?
CM: Well, let's look at it.
Sircrover: A huge eruption, a patronic, best-looking, clever, clever data, crab from the bottom to the bottom of the final code, a firefront with a politician named Kantikerker, who's got a slippery cabinet of Kanfiker, and he's got a slippery shack of cops.
CC: I'll ask you if you're going to wind up with the operating room, and you're going to throw out your best barric oxide.
Sirver: Anybody in a young man?
We've got a great view of the past data.
CC: Take the pickup of the bin Ladies, if you're a voice.
Sirver: It's going to be quick.
I'll quickly service your claims.
(Applause) My Penn: I'm painting all the time, and I've been learning how to hold a pencil, and I'm painting cartoons in tutoring with three gadgets.
And then I learned who's out there.
According to mediracy programs that most children don't know.
"When I realized that the roommen are the ones that make cartoons that I then look at the screen, I'm going to say, ""I'm going to be a real estate!"" I don't know if I'm happy to say it myself, or I'm myself, but it's been a big, consistent moment of my life."
The industry and art have always been the best at the right.
"But the curiosity of computer engineering came up with the idea of creating ""Malicos Disease,"" and then I started with my computer, and I was trying to get rid of it, and I suddenly thought, ""What if there was a little computer in the world in the computer?"
Maybe there's a Snanco where they come together to get rid of it?
So these are the Creative Cars.
When I was four years old, it showed me how to pick up a computer and put it back up.
And that's how I got lost to computer science.
So my first Internet connection I built on the HTML language, and now I'm going to speak of VivaScury and Pyt.
"I'm also developing a new operating facility, which is called ""Apellers."" It's about bees and other pollinators that exist in the neighborhood, and why they're good."
If flowers don't plant pollinators, all of you will assume that we're going to get out of plants, we're going to die off the road.
So I decided to use these cool tools to build and make them superheroes.
(Applause) (Braining noises) (Music) (Singing) Astaloter: Absolute! Too many more.
We need to understand the rest of the Asian people!
(Music) Thank you. (Applause) All of my transactions came up with ideas, but what is ideas?
Employment can be empowered.
Nearly, it's going to be sustainable and new developments.
Because it's really incredibly light-blowing.
If we weren't ideas, we wouldn't be anywhere in the world, there wouldn't be technology or engineering, there wouldn't be art, culture, our shame of life.
"When I was eight years old, I took my ideas and I opened up a company called ""The Alliance Man"" and he said to them the foundation of the Alliance for the planet."
(Laughter) I'm producing sustainable and acusalities.
I'm 13 now, and even though I started with a company in 2008, my artist, he was born much earlier.
A huge impact on me always saw art, and I wanted to put it into everything I worked on, including my company.
So I thought, you know, you know, you're going to make pieces of cloth in the house, and I thought, you know, you can make a hat or a balloon, and I had so much idea of processing stuff.
"And I noticed that if I carried my own expression, I stopped me from the street saying, "How beautiful. Where can you eat that?""
And I thought, you know, you can do this and discover a company.
Because I was only eight years old, I didn't have any business plan.
I just knew that I wanted to produce a wonderful thing, which would not be sustainable, and that I wanted to share with the people that were less likely to have in my life.
My mother taught me how to do it, and I went to the booth and I went to my head with lecturers, and I wrote a name on the birts and I would pay for each of my business.
I started making more artifacts like shepherds and balls and tangles.
Needless of my life started to buy it all over the world, and I've got the customers in Denmark, and Australia, Canada and other countries.
Well, I've had to learn a lot about driving on the right, such as a company called and fragility, how to maintain relationships with the poor, and see that they're better or worse.
We're starting to grow up in the middle.
And one day, when I was 10 years old, I was connected to the magazine to write Forebes.
(Laughter) And they wanted to write about me and my company in their room.
Now, how many of you are trying to, why do I grow ecological?
With a young age, I've been really interested in the environment and advances that they live in.
My parents taught me to share with one of the most widespread tools, and with intelligence and the possibility of going anywhere around the world.
I've learned that caves for clothing or even processing things that are dangerous for people and planets, and I started my research, and I realized that even after the reporting, there's a problem for the environment in what's going to happen to happen with the end.
At the end of the process, it's going to grow up or it's all its dry paint.
It's freezing the air by using it as temple for anyone and anyone who's breathing it.
So when I started with a company, I knew two things: I had to be ecological, and that 10 to 20 percent of my money had to leave a local and global aid organization.
(Applause) I think I'm part of the new global entrepreneurialists who don't just want to raise money, but they're also committed to the sustainable solution of the world.
I believe that I can try my customers, save the last generation, live a more sustainable life.
We live in a huge, diverse and wonderful world, and I'm still more likely to protect it.
Now, imagine what's happening in the world just through the mind and the mind — it's not enough.
All we need to be able to communicate through the heart, because that's what the idea of the organism is to freeze.
And that's when the inventions see the world, so ideas are real.
Thank you, everyone is happy and happy.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Pat Mitchell: Did you hear my parents talking about, how did my parents tell us about who's behind this wonderful woman? Where are they?
If you look up, ladies and gentlemen Pan, maybe you ... Wow.
(Applause)
Here's a couple of things that we're talking about.
Consumably connected to the things that are creative.
They're municipal collection of other species, and they're connected to each other in an emotional way.
Most of the crocodiles you see on the screen are not the dead stars, but the collection of zones or the galaxies.
Now, given you some of these challenges, I hope you'll quickly see that the integration of others isn't just a wonderful idea, but more than that, I think that it's about the combination of other mystery, they're going to look at, and they're good.
The winds are like the source of the poorest labs in the Universe.
And in your lab, the description of combinations is to describe the experiment that you can copy on it.
I think there are four primary you out there, and the first kind of thing that we want to tell you about is that it's not really great.
In fact, how great?
Okay, so that's one of the first things that we want to do.
It's so amazing that the light that comes through it, you wake up, it's scanned because of the equity of this unification.
And when you really look really closely, you're going to see circles all around you.
To be honest, it's this combination of other species that matters more than one billion people with their hands.
It's incredible how small these systems can be.
But more than that, they have a net value.
They're basically sustainable systems, and if you want to love it, we can think of them as small versions of the entire universe.
And in many ways, many of the things that might end up with us, the judgment of the universe, for example, how does gravity work?
You can answer the system to study these systems.
So that's what we said about an extraordinary benefit.
The other type is these things are really terrifying.
So if you take this together, and you get rid of all the light that comes out of the garden, then you get this big, big rabbit.
It's not moving the wheel.
So what we see here is really natural light.
And then the final question is, if it's not the galaxies, what's going to make that light?
If you look at the mountain gas, the newspapers will be halfway away — that's true of the plastics.
If you don't, that's the horror you can find on the foreground.
Now, the true gravitationality of these systems integrates lawns together, and it's a huge impact, and it's a huge reflection, it's a huge test.
So that's the fundamental meaning, but it's just the science of Arabic.
Now, there's a lot of other things that are particularly simple about this kind of plasma that, as long as we continue to look at us, and it's still going to unleash our definition of overheart pricing.
The third one is learning about learning a very mug.
To give you a sense of that, I have to tell you about a prisoner's story.
Most Industrial Revolution did not build attacks.
Your momn't come to mind.
Most of them come from a very mysterious mystery, which we call dark material.
The value of matter is something that's not really good at interacting, except for the cost of gravity, and, of course, we're going to want to learn more about it.
If you're interested in physical physics, you're wondering what happens when we're going to look at something about each other.
And dark matter is not an objective matter.
So how can we do that?
"And then answer this question, I'm going to ask you a little bit more, "What if there's a connection to the other side?""
Let's look at the challenge.
We remember that the galaxies are integrating the way the universe is, it's just a small version.
They're being transported from dark wind turbines, and that's what you see in this sketch of purple bullets.
The flowers are horror newspapers, and you can see, of course, you can see a lot of other things.
So what's going on here is the accelerator of propulsion in a very, very large scale.
And that's very important, because what it means is that it's very, very, very small effects that are hard to pull out into the lab can be rescued and rescued into something that we can see in the air.
So, it was very polite.
For example, why the intimate integration can teach us what is dark matter, the reason why the intangible integration can teach us about physics is very small is because they're so strong.
Chazing is something: physicists are very weird.
It's time that you're actually holding your head up.
If there's anything more strange, it has to be dark energy.
If I squeeze the air in the air, I expect it to be excerpt.
But I don't expect him to fly away from the pain and the pain.
So cosmological claims to say why the universe has exploded.
They don't understand why he's expanding from all the pain at the same time.
They're giving this extraordinary expansion of the name and putting it dark energy.
And we want to understand this more about it.
So the question that the big question is, what is dark energy going to affect the world's largest scale?
Trying it out, the building can build its own fish faster or less.
And the problem with the big scale is that the terrible complex is complex.
Let's look at software.
We need to get it right.
I love thinking about it by analogy.
To know how you're going to get a penny, the most important thing, is that it's not a model of the place in which one little bit of a fierce that's been rejected.
The most important thing is to study the most private people.
So I can learn a lot about the world's greatest scale, with the greatest private parts, and these parts are about the interconnectedness of the universe.
Lastly, I'm going to leave you with my talk, but you can experience yourself a little bit undermine.
So what do I mean by this is, what do I do about the well-to-definition integration, and I asked some of these reasons, but how do they really use it?
Well, for the answer, I want to work with Henry Ford when they asked him about cars.
"And he said, ""If I tried people what they needed, they would say, ""Well, they need more claws."" Our society is going to come from a very large problem."
And the solution is not clear.
They're not faster than cows.
They're asking an extraordinary number of science inventions.
So what we need to do is we need to look forward, but we also need to remember about innovation, inventions, inventions, inspiration — this stuff comes along as we've expanded our field of balancing when we step back when we look back.
And I have the best way to do this is to explore the universe around us. Thank you.
(Applause)
"So imagine you find yourself on the street in America and coming to your Japanese and saying, "Are you going to name this piece?""
"And you say, ""You're crazy. Well, that's Okliut, and that's Styrofat."
"It's called the shockers, and it's the jewelry."" He's like, ""Well, good. What's called this dish?"" And you say, ""Well, you don't know, you don't say it."
"The Americans have names; they have names; they're just zones of space between the E.T.s."" And he goes, and he's got some nasty and disastrous."
"Now imagine you're on the street, somewhere in Japan, walking up to someone next to you and saying, "Sorry, what's called this vector?""
"They say, ""Well, here's the bell of 17, and that's the bell of 16."" And you said, ""Well, good, but what's called this client?"" And they say, ""How do you say that person doesn't say."
There's a name in the skies.
Take a look at Google Maps. There's 14, 15, 1,6, 17, 19.
All of these things have names. The people are just zeros of space between the blahs.
"And you said, ""Well, good, but how do you know your hell?"" And she says, ""Well, that's simple: That's it."
"There are 17, home number 17, one, and you say, ""That's cool. But if you walk around the city, I noticed that there was nothing wrong with it."" And she said, ""Well, that's true. It's true if it's been built."
The house that was built for the first time is the number one home.
The house that was built is the number two house.
"It's home number three. It's simple. It's visions."" Here's me, I'm very happy that sometimes we need to get on the other side of the ground to understand something about what we didn't even know, and to understand that there's absolutely nothing wrong with this stuff."
For example, there are doctors in China who believe that their work is to improve health.
So every month, if you don't buy, you'll buy them, and if you don't buy them, you don't have to pay them, because they can't manage their work, and they're wealthy when you're healthy, not if you're good enough.
(Applause) Almost every musician is long-definition, design music. One, two, four.
"In North American music, it's the end of the phrase, halfway into the end."
You can hear it not just in the words, but also in the way they think of music, two, four, four times.
And this is also the right way.
(Laughter) Now, to say that in every case that's said about India, there's a contradiction that's also true.
So let's not forget that at TED or elsewhere, whether it's not true that there's any idea in Was or someone you're making, it's not true, it can be true.
Dogitoziamaaaaaaa.
