Today I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
I'm now working with solar technology.
And to my little beginning, we're going to get ourselves in the environment, and we're going to get it in.
And so we're looking at different sources of resources.
This is just a little video of what we're doing.
Huh — wait a minute.
It can travel a little while.
(Laughter) We just — I'm going to pass this feeling — I'm just going to pass through the video. (Laughter)
No. (Laughter) (Laughter)
(Music) That's not ... (Laughter)
Okay. (Laughter)
The sun technology.
Oh, what happened then?
Okay. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So I'd like you to pay attention to what you're doing.
And after a few minutes, we'll come back to this, and I hope that if you're learning about surveillance a little bit, it's going to change your life significantly.
We care a lot about the language of the body, especially the language of others taking care of our body.
The different things that we're interested in: (Laughter) in the direction that you're talking about, irresponsible, or indistinguishable eyes, or even hummingbling, or even hummingbling.
Interviewer: That's where they get to 10 numbers.
The fortunate police are held by the president of the United States.
We're missing it. We're collecting it.
It's never been seen.
We're trying to become invisible to the man.
You see, again, animals and people do the same thing.
When I see strong and unpowered, it emerges.
When I get started, we often tend to achieve the gestures of others.
So, if someone's powered to us, we're trying to figure out what's going on. We don't reverse their gestures.
In contrast, we're not going to obey it.
I've found that MBA students use massive amounts of power.
Some of them do it as an individual leader, and as they go in classrooms, they go to the middle of the building, and they don't get to school yet.
And when they're sitting, they're almost two people moving around.
They remove their hands in this way.
I gave myself a few results.
The first one probably won't happen to surprise you.
And it turns out that it's sex.
So women are more likely to obey this blood than men do.
And women often feel more vulnerable than men, and that's not bad.
And it's very important for MBA students, because their education affects the prices of price.
We've noticed business schools in general, and they're always going to fight.
And the women and women that we're preparing at at the same time are doing different prices at the end of the class, and it seems that it's based on it.
And I started thinking about myself, and I started thinking, well, they're more active in classrooms.
And if we want to show these images, will they not be able to do this kind of thing, but will they become more active in class?
So if we show ourselves strong for a short period of time, can we make ourselves feel stronger when we have the change in behavior?
We now know that our gestures and our magnets are understanding and thinking about others, and there's a lot of evidence.
But the question that really intrigues us is that these gestures and magnets affect ourselves.
So it's going to happen both things.
The question of consciousness is also the question of consciousness.
We're going to tend to attract gestes to see more power when we feel powerful and make it more powerful, but when we're trying to be strong, we also feel like we're strong.
What do I talk about when I think about it in terms of a sense of meaning?
I'm also talking about physiology that makes them form, and for me, these horsmons, I'm learning horsmons.
What is it that recognizes the minds of fluids?
But what you're seeing in the face of a blindness is 60 percent, and that's as important as enough.
This is what we found in testing.
Over the last few decades, 20 percent of the most powerful experiences they've ever since they've gone through, and more than 10 percent of them have ever been.
We have these changes in the future.
And this is what happens in the North Carolina.
In the hallway hallmark, 25 percent of the people in the audience have gone up to 15 percent, and more than 15 percent have gone.
It has led these external changes in the future for two minutes to make our brains feel more idiotic, confident, stressed and stressed.
These feelings are introduced to our raw, right?
So our language of our body determines how we feel and how we feel about ourselves, not just for others.
We're changing our thinking about our other body.
The next question that we're interested in is the question that we can change our life in a few minutes of power.
This is a two-minute expedition in the Cambodia.
So where can you apply it in real life?
Of course, that's what makes us really interested.
And in our sense, these poses can be used to recreate the price of creating social hazards.
Where do you usually get paid?
For those of you who've gone through schools, that's behind me.
For some of them, they're gathering this school.
For some of them, it's a human being or a business interview or a business interview.
Now, we've probably been surprised to think about business interviews, because it's a lot of your experience.
"So we've done a lot of evidence, and media has discussed them, and the jusnists have said, ""What do we do when we're dealing with business interviews?""
(Laughter) Of course, we've denied this idea. No, of course! We didn't know what we mean.
It's irrational!
It's not yours.
It's something that you can connect with yourself.
What do you think you've done before we start the interview?
You sit down. You look at Iphone or Android.
You look at your cats, you bend them, you get them up, and you have to do it, and that's probably what you have to do. That's what you're going to do. You're sitting on your way. You're sitting there for two minutes.
That's not what we wanted to do.
Now, since I've gone to the workshop, I've had a lot of work interviews, and I've had a lot of power and lack of power.
It was a video of five minutes of interviewing.
They were taught to be able to control the impact of those who were able to read the interviews, to prevent the impact of them. They looked like this.
For five minutes, looking at the unconsoredness of the planet is more self-replicating.
Nobody likes it.
"And Mario LaFrance calls this ""Pridge stays on the streets."" This is a human being that increases the level of corruptism."
To see the work, we've taken them through interviews like this.
And then we showed them four of these effects.
They were unaware of our dreams, our expectations.
"They didn't know what trouble it was, and as I looked at Video-rays, they said, ""We'd like to take it to work,"" they showed high power poses."
"""We don't want to take it to work."
"And before they're more positives."" What does that impact?"
This isn't because of their talk.
It's because they agree with their speech.
So let's look at other readings, for example, how smooth are the speeches?
What are the ideas of life?
This shows no difference.
What's really important is that it doesn't have the impact.
People just showed their true sadness.
So they turned themselves into a pattern.
They have no impact on their own, and they've shown themselves themselves.
Since then, it affects the reality.
"And when I tell people, we think about our body, our behavior, our actions, can change our results, they say, ""This isn't a little bit?"" And I said, ""Well, that's what we're thinking about."
I'm telling you how much image it's ever created.
"""I'm not that."
I don't want to be able to see anybody who's making them feel real.
I don't want to be a kid.
I don't want to be anywhere.
"I understand these words very well. I want to tell you a little story about being denial and ""I'm not my place,"" and it's a little bit of a story."
When I was 19, I had a lot of cars.
It's gone out of cars.
I became a few times everywhere.
I had to walk up on the regime of the destruction, I had to leave the collectors, and I've got to know that I've got to go out, and I've been on the news, and I've got to see that I've got to go down to two shows. It's very painful for me.
I was a IQ-moma expedition, because as a kid, I was known as a smart and brilliant kid.
Because I was taken out of school, I wanted to go back to school.
"They said to me, ""You're not going to be going to be done."
"It's a lot of what you can say, but you're not a college."" And I'm going to start doing that, and I'm going to tell you that the core feature that you have, to me, was that I'm not thinking about it, that there's nothing that you can get from your hand."
I felt completely vulnerable.
And I tried, I worked on it, and I worked on it, and I succeeded.
As a result, I was finished.
"I had to spend four years on my team and my friends, and Susan Fishi, who's my recommendation, and I agreed to take me to Prinston University, and I thought, ""I'm not a place that I'm not."
I was a resistant.
In Proston, I've been talking about the first 20-minute lecture that 20 people listen to.
It was going to be night.
"I was so frightened that I could hit my head and say, ""I'm not going to know."" He said, ""No, you're going to do it, I've come home when you're in the morning."
It turns out, it's going to be cool and you're going to do it.
And even though it's on the table.
You're going to have all the talks you have to do.
"Another, again, when you're scared and frightened, it's not obvious that your body has listened to you, you know, ""It's recent. I've been able to do it."
"I'm not sure if you're going to be working all the time."" And so I did."
"I've been reading high school for five years, and I've been working there for a few years, and I've been working there, and I don't think about it, but I've been thinking, ""This is not my place."" I've been thinking for a long time."
"So at the end of the first year I was in Harvard, he didn't consult once in a serendipity, and he said, ""You've got to go to a cabby, or you've got to be done,"" and he came up with a school cabinet, and I didn't know him well."
"He said, ""This is not my place."" He said, ""It's my place."
This became a return for me.
Because two things happened.
The first thing I realized was that I didn't have that feeling anymore.
But she felt it, and those feelings were introduced to me.
And the second thing was that I didn't realize that he was in the right place.
So it could be able to make images.
"And I said to him, ""Well, you're right here!"
"It's going to make itself look like this in the morning, and it's going to show itself as powerful and powerful."" (Applause) And he did that. He didn't know that he was sitting here a couple of months later, and he didn't know that he was there. (Laughter) And then he came to my answer, and he was able to make it really feel as real as possible, and he made it."
It was changed.
And I'd like to tell you that.
Picture as much as reality.
Just show yourself as much as you want to do.
I knew I wanted to come back.
And it can create a lot of changes that make it possible for us to make it possible.
Now, that's two minutes before I said.
Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.
Over the next time, before you can calculate a setup, try and do that, let's try and do it. Lift, in the living room, in the table, or in the back of the door.
Have you ever wanted to impact.
So root your intelligence to the best way.
Make up your testosterone. You decrease your tongue.
"""I haven't shown them what I can do."" Don't let them do it with remorse."
"You see, ""I've been able to show them who I am,"" and how I show them."
And I'd like to tell you that if you apply these power poses to the table, I'd like to add it to each other, it's very simple.
It's not a self-interest. (Laughter) It's a lot of learning, and it's a lot of people who can talk about, and it's a lot of people who can benefit from that, and it's not just technology and resources, it's people who don't have stocks and power.
They're able to do it with them that they know that you can't use them.
Teaching attention to all of their cells can impact their lives for two minutes.
Thank you.
(Applause)
And I'm sure we've got some of these moments in the world.
It's the most invisible among their superpower.
They're like they're doing, and they're the guys who've put together an ephalical material to live.
The Katadadian workers are working hard, urgent and necessary for all of us to benefit, but they're not thankful for that.
Here, in Brazil, 90 percent of the products that will happen again — they collect.
Most of the Katadors work together. They've gone out of the streets, and they've gone out of the streets, and they've gone back to the center.
Carrats are looking for the taxes, or metals, and they're remembering the culture of waste, or shrink, or shrunk.
And that's why I met these superstars.
I'm a traffic image and an activist, and in my works, it's about social policy and environmental preservation of the environment.
In 2007, I was bumping up the city's life, and I was moving my work out of wallets.
But this time, I was also supporting the foldor.
My work has taken a lot more attention to art and engineering, and it's helped me bring these foldors into a focus center and make them trustworthy.
Today, they're famous in the press and social media media.
And it turns out that since I met this world, I've always worked in this region since I met it.
I've been brought up to more than 200 shrimp in many cities, and I've been invited to go around the world with more passengers and girls.
I've come to the difference that they're building with invisible spaces, not just to belong to Brazil, but to Brazil.
It came to them in Argentina, China, South Africa, Turkey, even Yaponi and the United States.
After that, I realized that more people should be attracted to this, because it was a big job.
"And after that, I created a movement under the title of ""Pimp My Carrocades."" (Laughter) — it's a movement that's built by people's funding."
Thank you.
(Applause)
So, it was a huge movement in people who were helping to make my carrot, and to help their shrimp, to help them.
The doctors, the psychologists, the pediatricians, the hair storageists, the tablejapists, and they're known like this, and they're encouraged by professional health services and health services.
And also, as the shrimp used by our volunteers, they would sell security taxes, they wouldn't go rain, and they wouldn't look good at it.
They've taken other tools for the U.S. intelligence: complex logistics, and a mirror of fluids.
And finally, they would be part of this great, great, big plane crossing crossing by the little artists.
"It's called ""Sao Paulo,"" and Rio de Janeiro de Kuribito and Kuribita."
"But what we did was we inspired TEDx to meet the students in the city outside of Battle, and we created the Pumpx, which is a new version of people, which is ""The Great Depression"" that's easy to make it so that it's free, that it's free, that it's free for us to fund it."
So everybody could join the meeting.
Over 200 years, 1700 volunteers and 800 volunteers, and more than 200 percent of them, have already moved from the icebor to the movement of the Creative Commandment to the local school, and with their help, we've been able to go back to school.
Now, when the people who would put themselves back in the invisible world would be the people who were respecting and worthwhile.
They know that you're coming up with ideas that are amazing because of their profits, they know that their revenues and their relationships with the community are increasing.
And I'm going to give you now the folders in your city, and I'm calling you the other invisible superheroes, and I'm trying to recognize them.
Try to see the Earth as a whole, without borders and tolerance.
It doesn't mean it doesn't exist, it's more than 20 million times in the world.
When you see someone coming to it, you know them as part of the life of our society.
Muito Orbigado, thank you.
(Applause)
In five Noyraw, 1990, the manager of the All-Saharan world, called Manhir Nhidu Khiru, in 1990, was able to compromise him in the middle of the Manhattan world, and the leader of Mee Kirhahan, which is the Lukima of the Yahs.
We used to know that the first thing that it was made of was not guilty of, but when it looked at it in the middle of the high-definition, the other people in New York City were in a series of albiies: tunas, synagents, squirrels, and the U.N. and the U.N. plans were preparing for cells.
Luckily, the plans of FTB were brought down by partnership.
But sadly, in 2004, the World Trade Center couldn't be bombarded.
In the last century, Normir Square was born at a quarter.
Al-Saharan Kamid is my father.
In 1983, Pennsylvania, his missionary son, Pittsburg, and his compassionate son, I opened up the world as a prophecy class, the router, the router, the golden rule of the classroom, and it made me feel like I've been able to sleep out of their hands for having a happy childhood.
My family began to change my life after my age.
My father made me see the side of Islam as many Muslims, many Muslims, many of whom have seen me.
And what I've learned from my life experience is that after people know each other as well as enough, it actually doesn't take much time to understand that each of us has the same expectations of life.
Every single one of those people, every single mill, every single one of them, can be found to the people who have the impact on their faith and others, and to look forward to their own lives, that we're going to be able to have the tools, and that we're going to have a little bit of damage.
A few months ago, my father was in front of me, and my father, a couple of weeks ago, and he understood that he was working with friends in London, and he understood that they were training paqona athletes.
And he told me that I couldn't go with him in the morning.
We cracked in the Kvalverton Atgegon, and we didn't know that there was a secret observer of the FTB-A.
And my father helped me hold me on my desk, and he started to figure out how to target the 30-meter nukel.
The last laugh that I jumped on this day came to a little stick on the moon on the moon, and it was taken as a result of it, especially me.
"And I'm saying to the other men, "Ibrahah," from Arabic, he said, "It's a leg.""
We all laughed about it, but after a few years, I understood what they were laughing.
They thought that my father could be able to do it, and that's what he saw.
And in the last case, these people were known as the Earth's Furgon, which was filled with 700-pound substantial matter, where the Earth Ticuffy was, and by the way, it was known that six people were dying, and 1,00 people were going to benefit from the 1960s.
These are people that I take my self.
"Don't you"" — they were the people I called."
And as I was 19, we changed our lives for 20 times, and as I had changed my childhood, it caused my friends to be less alive.
If I had my self, it would be that my self would not be able to move to my family, but to move to another city.
I always became the objective of children, as a new one, and often a child.
I kept my self behind my classrooms to be in the middle, but it turned out that it was the best of the classroom, and it was the ability to be in the classroom.
So I spent a lot of time reading books in the house, watching books and playing games.
So there was a conflict of social communication in my ability to communicate, and I didn't have the realization of life as a person growing up in the spectrum of fancy.
I grew up in a environment where human beings are inherently responsible for race and religion.
So what happened to me? What opened my eyes?
So one of the first experiments I've ever tried to think about this kind of way has been the election of the 2000th century.
I've been able to participate in the National College of University, a university program that's in Fladel, and I've been able to participate in the University of New York.
The group that I'm a young group of people have been involved in the violence, and I didn't think it was a lot of my life, and I didn't care about it as if it was the one who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid who was a kid, and I didn't care about it.
Our team's family was a variety of ways of life.
I've learned that one of the children I've been friends with in the last days in the country, was Jewish.
And we found this in a couple of days, but I realized that it wasn't possible for us to be able to have a major impact between both of us.
I had no Jewish friend before, and in fact, I felt like I was proud of my life that I had never been abused.
And then it turned out to be a more important part, and I found some work in the Yats of Busch Gardens.
I was in the project of people here who have different faiths and culturalities, and this experience has played the fundamental role of what we've experienced.
I've been taught that a lot of my life is guilty of homosexuality, and in fact, I've been taught that all gay impacts have a lot of impact on it.
It did so that in one of the audience, I had the opportunity to work with gay artists, and by the way, many of them were the most promising people I've ever seen as a result of people who were the most pronounced ones.
I found it. I felt like I had a sense of a gift to others at a time when I was a kid, and it kind of came around and felt like I didn't want my own self to do something else.
With this sense of experience, as a kid, I was able to make it compared to the experience of life as a child.
I'm unaware of what it feels like to be alive, but I'm not very good at what it's like to be able to hurt from what it's worth.
"And then he became ""The Daily Sow."" And the John Stuart led me to urge me about the humankind, and he helped me realize that the human race, the religious sexuality, was not based on the fact that religion and sexuality of sexuality, had helped me realize that he didn't have an interest in the literature."
And at the time when I needed the ancestor, John Stuart, he was literally fished to me.
The Jewish commissioner of inspiration has not come from a very long time-long place, and the StoryCorps of Jewish communism in my world have not come out of the narrative that my father has more positives than my father has ever seen.
One day, I had a conversation with my mother about the change of my world, and my mother told me a word that I'm not sure I'm standing up for my lifetime.
"My mother looked at me with a lot of heroic eyes, like someone who lived enough tomatoes in my life, and said, ""I hate to hate people."
I realized that it was giving us a lot of energy to hate it in a moment.
My Zak Ebrah is not my real name.
I changed my name when my parents decided to start our relationship with my dad new life.
Why did I have a whistle and a danger in my life?
The answer is very simple.
And I hope that maybe one of the things that I'm going to think about is that maybe one of the things that I'm going to hear in a story is that you can hear it in my story, and you know it's going to be on the right road, and there's no way I'm going to be fancy even though I'm not going to be born with ideology.
Instead, I chose to use my life as a result of translation and anti-material struggle against my ignorance and our feminism.
And I'm going to do that with the sweatshops and their aspirations, the horrific pain and the firemen that they live with.
I'm not going to be able to raise my father's movements in this sort of penalty process, and I'm going to end up standing in the motion of my father.
Like the simple example of my family, I'm a living creature to be able to have the way that my son is going to go through my religion and our race.
I'm not like my father.
Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
No morning!
It's unconventional?
"They took a step on it. But I wanted to ask you, ""What's your name?"" And here's a guy named on the subject in Arabic?"
Anyone else? Anybody? OK, no problem.
So one day a while ago, I sat up with my mentor, and I was eating food.
"I looked at it, and I said, "You've got it? (Laughter)"
He looked at me by thinking that word was equal to mistakes.
"And he said, ""Look what? (Laughter) And I said, ""Great it?"" And he said, ""You know, it doesn't laugh."" He said, ""I don't know what?" "I know.""
"He said, ""No! No! It's called him ""cou"" or ""mother."" Is that unhappy?"
"He said, ""I don't think you should be doing it!"" He said."
"He was so frustrated to talk to me, and he said to himself, "I wouldn't look at him if there were the greatest girl in the world.""
"What does it mean to say ""Menou"" in Arabic?"
In my future, Livian young boy, who said she was back in her daughter, and she didn't make sense.
How could we talk that way?
And then I started thinking.
It made me angry.
That's a guy that's actually trying to get the error!
They don't accept me in my own country because I'm speaking in a language.
Where else can you get?
What do we see here?
But we've got a lot of people here, like me, who can go to a moment in their own lives so that they can only draw them as an extraordinary human nature to know that they're just modern and cultural.
What if I had to forget my entire civilization, my mind, my experience, my life, my life?
We could have had the best lives of childhood experiences about suicide!
I've just changed everything that I learned in Arabic.
Should I forget being one of them?
What was the irrational thing here?
Nevertheless, I tried to understand him.
I didn't want it to make sure that it didn't make me happy.
The Arabic language doesn't respond to the students of this day.
It's not the language of science, it's not the language of science, it's not the language of science, and it's not the language that we've been accustomed to the work that we're used in college, and it's not the language that we use in the airport.
If we were to think about it, they would say our clothes.
What about my language? What about my language? We all need to ask these questions!
You don't want to use Arabic. Are we going to use it?
It's reality.
But there is another more important reality that we have to think about.
The Arabic language is the native language.
It's called the search, which is that if you've got to be perfect in the core, in other languages, you've got to be perfect.
In Ana, perfection is a condition to be able to express their ideas creatively in other languages.
How?
When Cibran Xili Cibran started writing for the first time, he used Arabic language.
His whole ideas, his dreams, his special ruins, had been sourceed from a small boy in the village, who grew up with his special voice heard.
So, when he was writing in English, he had enough base.
In fact, when you read his writing in English, you felt that he was in English, you'd have that feeling, you'd have that feeling.
You can imagine, that's what he wrote in English, that son from the Livan mountains.
This is an example of who's not going to disagree with.
Second, it's called the counter- synthesis that if you want to kill a mill, it's the only way you kill the mile, it's to kill the body.
It's a reality of the society that has developed.
The Germans, they're French, they're jewelry, they're jaws — these milestones are aware of the tension.
So they're not going to make sure that they protect their own language.
They're sacred to it.
So they're using a lot of money to improve language.
Do we know more of them?
Well, we don't know about the world that's developed, it's not yet an idea that we'd never come to us, and we'd like to stand up with the cultural world.
And once it was time that we were doing research for us, but they were able to move around in those countries with Tanzania, Malaysia and s. And as they went down to the country, they were able to protect themselves as they were not going to take it.
They're not familiar with each other.
Because if you take a product from Turkey or somewhere else, and there's no tag on it, it's not a local product.
You didn't believe it was a local product.
They would be the receiver as they were before. They're the qualities that we're most of the time.
So they had to protect their own language to innovate and make things.
"I'm telling you what will happen to you in Arabic?"
Don't remind us what, right?
Even though who is, and why.
The language is happening not just by words that come from networks, but by conversation, it's not tools for us to talk about.
The language is a certain stage of our life, and it's a terminology that depends on our emails.
"So we're going to go and say, ""Listenity, water, independence,"" special pictures in every one of you have a special history, in private history, have special feelings."
It's not a language, two words or three letters, but a language doesn't compromise the letter.
It's the idea that we think about how we see each other, how we see each other, how we relate to each other.
What is the objective?
You can say, well, that's a human head-to-face, right?
"So if I'm going to say, well, well, well, I'm like, ""Spossity, water."" Or if you can come to your son, your son says to come up and say, "Did you have a life of liberty?""
What does it feel like?
If you don't see the problem, it might be good that I would come out and talk to the empty place.
That's what it means to remind us of something special.
I have a French friend who is married with French.
And one day I asked him, how does things go?
"He said, ""Everything's good. But I've been trying to translate the word 'cause'"" for him one night — (Laughter) (Applause) The Yazi woman is wrong, and then she's not trying to explain her all the words at night."
"And he stayed with his wife, and he said, ""Well, you know, how can you be so profitable?"
What does he want to evaporate?
"He said, ""It's me? (In Arabic) This is one example of a few examples."
We started thinking, well, because we couldn't deal with it, women can't say that word to it, and they're okay to do that, and they're different in thinking about it.
"He said to me, ""Oh, he listen to me, and I try to translate it to him at one night, and I'm trying to listen to him, and when I listen to Firuz, you feel what I've learned."" He tried to translate it to him, he tried to translate it for him, ""I've built my hand and I've made it into it."" (Laughter) And that's the problem: "I've brought it back to them, and I've brought you."" (Laughter)"
So translate this to me.
(Applause) What did we do to protect Arabic?
We've turned this into the issue of citizenship, and we've started campaigning to protect Arabic.
"And then a lot of people said to me, ""Why would you be worried?"
"It's fun for us to forget and for us."" There's no problem!"
"And that was the title of the campaign to protect his own will be, "I'm speaking to you from the far east, and you're responding to me from the West.""
"We didn't say, ""Yox! We didn't know it or we didn't think it."" We didn't choose that way, because they didn't stop us."
And if someone tells me about it, I hate to translate it to Arabic.
We say, (Applause) We want to change our reality and change our dreams and our aspirations and our everyday lives.
We're going to get attracted to white things like us and think about things like us.
"So we're like, ""I'm talking to you from the far east, but you're going to answer me from the West."" It's a picture."
It's very simple, it's also creative and creative.
And then we started campaigning another campaign that was written in the soil.
"And what you've seen in this example is that you've seen this example, on the scene of the black and yellow strip, "Don't kill your skin!""
Why? It's really, don't kill.
We need to kill our language from nature.
If we had to kill our language, we would be able to identify ourselves.
We would be able to destroy our existence.
We would have to go back to the beginning.
It's serious about losing our chance to be modern and cultural.
And after that, we released images of girls and girls wearing Arabic letters.
"""Col"" is a picture of girls and boys."
We're very familiar with it.
"And who told me, ""Oh, you used English!"" I said, ""Oh, I'm okay! I'm a word 'col' 'cause I'm a naive.' 'coy' if they're in denial, don't know how much they're going to do it.' But give me a better word, let me say that the reality is better."
"I'm going to go and say, ""I'm going to go on the Internet."" And I'm like, ""I'm going to go to the planet."" (Laughter) Because it doesn't work! We shouldn't take ourselves."
But we have to believe that if it's a language, we don't let the people think it's bigger, or we should not let them think it's bigger in our pockets, we should not be able to let them think that it's driving us and asking us what it's asking for.
It's an idea of creation.
If we can't fly into the universe, or we can't make rockets, we can be creative.
We've been doing an art project right now, all of you.
It's a way of creativity in your native language.
Let's start with this.
Let's write a novel and take a short film.
If the novel can make us global again.
This could lead to the Arabian again, to become a neutral.
"There's no way to say, ""There's no way to talk."" There's no way to talk!"
But we have to know, and we have to believe that there's a way to talk, and that's part of the way we talk.
What can you do today?
The gravitations, who is gravitating?
If I'm starting time, I'm going to ask you so much, whether it's Arabic, or English, or English, or in a jaw.
But don't write in Arabic with numbers of Latin graphs in Arabic.
(Applause) This is disaster! This is not language!
You enter the viral world with viral language.
It's not easy to roll back from a place like this.
This is not the first thing we can do.
Second, there are many other things that we can do.
We're not gathered here today to believe each other.
What we're here is that we're going to take care of the importance that we protect this language.
And I'm going to tell you a secret.
He's known for the first time through the language of apologizing to the ceremony.
"When my daughter was born, I'm going to say to him, ""That's your horse. We're going to do it."" I'm not going to say, ""Tish it in English."" And I'm talking to him, my daughter Naura, who said, ""It's okay."" And I said, ""You know, I'm not going to say it in Arabic, and I'm going to say, ""I'm not going to say it."" And he said, ""I'm not going to say it's okay."" And he said, ""I'm not going to tell him, and I'm not going to say, ""I'm not going to do it."
(Applause) Let's start ourselves by doing this cultural configuration. (Applause)
I learned a few things when I was experimenting these 30 days.
I took a picture every day for you for the next month.
I was 30 days before I started experimenting.
It's bad.
In fact, they're fun.
(Applause)
I was high on my expectations of modern literature, and I started with a student of students, a life of students, a sense of love, a conversation, a food, and a way of working on it.
And yet, in my mind, the catastrophe feels unacceptable, I'm afraid of the people who are left to be alive, the failure of the future, and the space that I've experienced in me.
"And as I walked away, as I did before, when I left the floor and left the room, I would have an equal voice, and suddenly I would say, ""Oh, he's leaving the room."" I walked around."
There was no one in my side. The light of the debris and the preciseness of my neighborhood.
"""He opens the door."" — I equal."
It was a beginning. It was a projection.
And just days ago, after weeks, I've been talking about everything, and I've been talking about it to me in the face of 200 percent.
"He goes, ""He's going to go."
"What's wrong with it, and it's quiet, and it's quiet and hopeful for a while, and I've come to this idea that the sounds of the sounds of the sounds that I don't know when I'm walking around, it doesn't mean it's happening."
For example, when I'm a non-sumer, I'm often mysterious and real-world experience, and I'm often angry.
And it turns out that the logging came out: normal people don't equal sounds, and it was a serious positance for me to be equal.
I was suffering from the college doctor.
I needed this curiosity, this curiosity, and I needed help, and I started talking about it.
"For example, I was working like a student's public news report on students, and I'd say, ""I'd like to go to college at night, and I'd say, ""I want to go to school."
And then the position began to come out of my fast surveillance.
I've been fed to cafeteria, and I've been looking for you, and then the top one is: It's got a sense of hope, a sense of courage, a sense of spirituality, a sense of compassion, a sense of hope, that we're going to come to my future.
My voice, not because I'm a simple experience of life, but because I'm convinced that it's a symbol, and that it's a self-interest.
My mind was a kind of psychiatrism, a war against my mind, and as a result of the sounds, the voices started to expand and become more violent and angry.
Can you see the water in it?
As a result, it's been a result of fear, a lack of uncertainty, a lack of understanding, a lack of understanding, a sense of self-interest, a fight that I felt immortality to create peace and peace and peace in this war.
Two years later, I got bad.
Now, I've been with all my daughters: horrific sounds, bizarre images, unimaginable.
Now, when you look at the wreck and hopelessness of those years, I think one person died, and one person saved it.
It's been sent to a journey of people who are isolated and dense, and it's going to get out of that journey, and it's going to be able to turn back to a person that I should be doing.
Over my lifetime, a lot of people hit me, and I remember all of them, but it was very weak and very respiratory compared to people who helped me.
Well, Eleanor will be able to do that.
"And sometimes it's the same, and sometimes it's the absolute emerald."" At 14 minutes, I was asked to thank you for these wonderful people who were looking back to the equation and to come back to peace for me, and thank you for those people who were waiting for me to come back to the city."
Of course, the invisible sounds were hard to believe that they were unimaginable, and so I didn't learn to understand what I really counted before we step first.
For example, I've learned to tell you about the sounds that they're going to go to my house — and the real objects are not like the danger, but the feeling of the fear that I feel, and the feeling of danger.
I didn't really believe them.
I remember sitting in the door of my parents sitting in the door at night thinking about them to protect me from the sounds that I'd actually made.
"You don't know what to do with you."
"What am I doing?"" He said, ""You know, I've got a lot of pessimism?"" That was Stratbei."
And after realizing that, it turns out that I'm a little bit of a mess, and I'm living in the last part, and we're building drugs from drugs that are rewarded, and that time I've gone back to a whole other role of psychiatrism.
Now, I'm very proud of being the prophecy of the international campaigns, the Acheroic Age, the organization of each individual species, and Professor Marus and Dr. Sandra Echerker's work, and that attempts to come out of the work of the work of the Sandrachers, and it's an abnormal experience, and it's not as if it's a problem, but it's not as a student, it's a necessary to learn, and it's a very important to learn.
This kind of community is not able to do it, but it's already built.
There's a similar saying that if social change started, there's no way back.
It doesn't mean it's going to hurt people.
Now, it's not going to pressure people who don't worry about.
In the last 20 years, the Royal Embrace has been spread across five continents and 26 countries, and a team of people with dignity, I'm passionate and soulfulness, and we'll be able to expand the possibilities of the people with difficulties, hopefully, and we'll be able to go to the next year and join the director, and there's a potential potential of our culture.
As Pitter Levin said, it's an unimaginable thing to use this ability to do with human health.
And in this case, the greatest honor for our community — to help someone who needs to be healthy, to be with, to reach hand, to share and to connect with you, to make sure that he needs to be healthy.
We're unique. We're unlikely.
It's not going to take us to do what's happening in our skin, or to destroy us.
The light doesn't turn off.
"And as a friend of mine once told me, ""It doesn't mean what others are doing when you're in your bar."
"It's about your own."" Thank you very much."
(Applause)
I'm here to talk about my photographer.
But what about this photographic?
Because, of course, it's not a picture that you can draw with our camera.
But yet, my love of photography started when I first photographed my 15-year-old photographer.
I've doubled this with my own experience of an artist, but in a slightly different way, because as I've been using a camera, I've planned it from a kind of beginning.
And when you took a picture of the photosynapon, it would be ready to do it when it hit hit it.
And for me, the picture was not only created by the right place in the right time.
So I thought, well, anybody can do that.
So I wanted to do something different, and this is what it started to evolve after the picture was taken.
The images like this: the construction that's going on in a way.
But it's an unexpected game.
And yet, it looks close to reality.
Or pictures like this, both of the dark colors and the dark colors, but they're all very expressive to protect certain kinds of realization.
When I say diarrheism, I mean photography.
Because, of course, I don't want images that we can really see, but I don't want photos that are visible to the camera.
I don't want to think of a little bit of a picture if you're going to think about it.
So it's really about trying to make sense that this moment is much more accurate than capturing it.
So what about the fact that he made his real appearance?
Or is it relevant to color?
Is it relevant to light?
What creates the light?
Sometimes it's a perspective of the perspective that makes the difference.
But at the end, how did the world deal, how did it work in two-dimensional subscriptions?
It's not really what this reality is, it's really what the visible ones are.
So the basic idea is very simple.
I'm putting it into a real experience, and I'm seeing it with a real tapestry, a reality that I'm experiencing.
Let me show you a simple example.
There are three numbers here that are perfectly imaginable physical objects, three-dimensional features of our world.
But in a certain way, it looks like the three-dimensional object that's going to exist again.
And we also know that it can't exist.
So we're playing our brains because our brains can't recognize that reality is not the meaning of reality.
And I see the same process as we combine pictures.
It's actually about integrating the different reality.
So the things that we don't think about, I think, are the things that we don't think about, in our everyday lives, are the things that are around us.
And when images combine images, it's really important to see this because, in contrast, it seems wrong.
What I'd like to say is that there are three simple rules that we have to follow in order to get a real result.
As you can see, these images don't have a special location.
But united together, you get something like this.
So the first rule should be the equivalent of the perspective of images that are united.
Second, images of united pictures should be the same as light.
And both of these conditions, these two conditions — very high and very high light.
And for some reason, the image of the structure is to make the difference, to distinguish where one ends, where another starts from.
You're not going to be able to put together the way the structure is created in a way that's not possible.
We can make boundaries of color and contrast between different images, and the depth of the surface, and the color of the surface, the left-handed colors and X-rays, and we can also use boundaries between pictures and pictures that look like a single image, and yet there are hundreds of details.
Here's another example.
(Laughter) People might think that this is the image of a field, and some of it has changed.
But in fact, this picture is completely united by pictures of different places, and it's formed by us.
I think it's easier to make a place than to find a place, and that's how you need to change your ideas if it's less.
But it requires a lot of plans.
And I knew I had a few months to plan and find the parts of tapir that were fundamentally different from the winter, and to find them where they were going to be different.
So, for example, it was taken when I was holding a picture of the bell.
And the sub-Saharanets are alien creatures.
I was painting six of them on a rock.
And yes, even at the peak of the room, I went to red to make it look more like Sweden.
So, I think it's possible to get something close to it, and I think it's possible for planning.
It always starts with a black, an idea.
And then it brings together different pictures.
It's like this, it's all very good planes.
And if you take pictures well, the result may be quite beautiful and distinctly realist.
So we need all of these things, and the only thing that makes us limited is our imagination.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Well, thank you, thank you.
It was given a data like this, which is Wikeaks, and you're creating more data in the years than all the world's media broadcasts.
Can we do that?
JA: Yes, that's true?
The rest of the world's worrying about doing so bad, right? A small group of activists could spread a lot more information than all the media around the world.
CA: How did you do that?
How does people spread these documentations?
How is it preserved in the principle of wisdom?
JA: And as much as we know, they're the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones that are staring at us. There are different ways that these data are coming to us.
We're not paying attention to a country like Switzerica and Switzerica to prevent it from being comfortable with information on the Internet, allowing the law to be preserved.
It's doing encrypt or simplistic, and it's making a format, and it's making a format — and it may be a little difficult in terms of massive information — it's a little difficult — it's open to public and it's possible for political cells, and it's a self-interest.
CA: So documentation is meant to be responsible, so you don't know who the source of information has been.
JA: That's true. We rarely know them. If we're going to lose the source of information, we're going to destroy it immediately.
(Clapping) Let's hit the phone.
(Laughter) CA: I think CIA-di, asked TEDsters. (Laughter)
Let's take a look at what we have here.
This is the data that we've ordered a few years ago.
Let's look at you.
It was a story from Kenya.
How do you talk about telling this story?
JA: This document is Krold Report.
After 2004, 2004, the government had been conducted by the Kenya.
By 2004, Kenya ran against Daniel Mio for about 18 years to change the election in 2004.
It was a sewer in Kenya.
With the power of California, the Kibabi government, when they came to the challenge of corruption, they published two million dollars of spending.
The government, in Kenya, in Kenya, and now the richest man, was using it as political power.
It's like a holy book of a Kenya journalist.
In 2007, 2007, I knew that the election of November had just been to Kenya, and I could get documentaries.
We started to approach this account with the new president, President Kibabi, Daniel, who, three days after we started to get to the money of Mino, and we published it, and then he became the Catholic Church.
CA: So it's not directly to Kenya's press, but it's driven by roadways. And what you're thinking is that it changed the outcome of the election.
JA: Yeah. Yes. Before the Guardian was on the page, and then in the region of Kenyania, Tanzania and Cubi in Africa.
The news came out of the news.
In a few days, Kenya started writing the press comfortable about the issue.
20 days later, Kenya was published in the press, and Kenya had changed about 10 percent of the sounds of the security services, and that led to the election results.
CA: So what has changed the world that you've ordered?
JA: Yes.
(Applause) CA: But this time, there's a video about the air cell in Bad.
Video itself is a little longer. This is a short shape.
First of all, I'm going to tell you that there's a little bit of a show on this video.
Radio: ... wasteful, just popping up.
Now they look at it in Xammer.
We can see it. It's cool.
Watch everybody. Watch it.
Tell everybody.
It's cool. It's cool!
(Beatboxing) Okay, go on. (Laughter) It's cool. It's OK.
Ottel ... Bushster Two-Six, Bushster Two-Sex.
He'd have to go back, now!
We killed eight people.
We've got two taxyots, we're continuing to halve.
It happened. They all died.
Two-Six, Two-Six, Two-Six-Six is moving, moving.
Oops. Don't don't. What was that?
Rather, Kyle. Oh, he's got a solution, haha.
CA: What's the effect of this video?
JA: It's been heavy for people who are suffering from this.
This is a video that was sent to two people who were involved in the study of Bagha.
This is actually one of three cells in the video.
CA: If I don't see it, I don't know how 11 people die in this cell, 11 people died if you don't see it?
JA: Yeah. The two Re computer computers died, two children were killed.
In my childhood, one886 men died.
CA: And this has led to a vast amount of clarity that's published.
Why was it because of the anger and the scarcity?
JA: I don't know, I don't know, I think people saw the lack of power.
The Apollo taxes of people who are comfortable with the same age as the Apollo taxes are laughing for 30 miles, and without any reason — and even killing the people who have saved the rest of the world.
There were two journalists who were making sure that they weren't buyers, and they were doing their job.
CA: The U.S. security network, Bradley Manned, and he's reported that with video video in the survey, it's been told to you that it's been the summer of 20,000 U.S. expeditions.
Is that true?
JA: We made these scripts denial.
Five days ago, it's been jailed after 50 years when it's gone from 150,000 writeings.
In this year, we've been publishing documentaries of the Reykyvascal U.S., but they don't have the relationships.
The journey became my journey.
CA: If you went to the U.S. journey, did you get the subatomic documentation?
JA: We'd publish them. (CA: Can we publish them?) JA: Yeah. (Applause) JA: What's it from the mating?) JA: So in these documentaries, what's really happening in the world is that we've found the human poses in countries.
If you open up specific documentations, you have these kinds of materials.
CA: Let's talk a little bit about this.
What are you based on ideology?
What do you do when you publish specific documents? What do you think is it's true?
JA: So there's a question like this, which information for the world can lead to rediscover.
In fact, it happens a lot.
It's a cigarette cigaric to imagine that these newss that they're trying to hide in order to create economic power, that new and good thing can happen, and the institutions that have these information know how to hide the information themselves.
And that's what happens, and that's the history of modernists.
CA: But it's not dangerous, it's not dangerous, it's not bad for you, and it's not bad for all of the community.
JA: But not yet in the data that we're spreading.
So, we have policies of preserving damage.
There's some personal information that's going on, and that's what everybody's doing, and then they're publishing it.
And then there's also laws — it's kind of the secret that I'm talking to my young people about, and that's because they're preserved by law. But we're working with the news pollinators that really do what they do.
CA: It's all good at doing things.
"Every single person in the U.S., who gave you a service, told you, ""You know, you're going to publish what you want to do with your purpose?"" This is a video."
The people of the U.S. military are laughing when they're laughing.
In this world, millions of people around the world show that the military is not human. It's not.
"My son isn't like that. What are you courageous?"" What did you answer?"
JA: Well, it's a lot like this.
But keep in mind that in Iraq, in Afghanistan, people in Afghanistan don't need to see this video; they see it every day.
It doesn't change their minds. It doesn't change your dignity, it doesn't change their feelings.
They see it every day, and so on and so on.
It's not going to change people's relationship to this war, but that's what we want.
CA: So you're a way to highlight government and companies secretly.
It's good to light.
But what's odd is that, in order to light theirts, you should keep the sources of self hidden.
JA: It's not exactly. It's not yet that those of you who are against WikiLeaks.
Or we don't have information that's very different from the sources of resources.
If they have that, and they can be difficult for us, so we're working so that men who are doing business with us are trying to help us do things that are helping us to do things.
CA: I'm also interesting to me in the same way that I'm talking about — what do they think about it?
There are two kinds of ideas about WiLeaks and Judan.
One is — I'm happy to light up the requirements.
The second one is dangerous.
Who would think that my God is my God?
Why is it dangerous?
JA: Well, there should be a couple of guys who may not be.
CA: These were my clients, Jayan, who laughed.
We have to work a little bit. Let's show you another example.
I don't think it hasn't been published yet, but it's going to be published at TED.
What's interesting about this recently?
What is that document?
JA: This is an example of what we see every day.
Last year — here's the Noyota — there's been a partnership like the Gulf of Mexico in Albai, and it's not as powerful as the Gulf of Mexico, although it's not.
We decided to have an engineering figure like this, and actually, I've been able to live with the way that the farmers in the high-party stores put in the market.
The British government and others were here.
But the idea of success was that there was no relationship with them. It was a little difficult document.
We didn't know what it was writing and what it was.
We were a little bit curious that the competition may be the vote of oil companies.
"So, we looked at documentations, and we said, ""Well, we're a little less suspicious."
We can't know how to do it.
"Well, it's a document. We can't see it all day, but we can't show it out."" And we asked this company that was trying to answer the sources of information before, and this text was a text company — (Laughter) — and it said, ""We want to get to the sources of information."" And we said, ""Give a little bit of data."
What document do you talk about?
What does it mean to you as a legitimate law?
"What are you really about?"" And they sent a picture of a documentary of a documentary of the Mozzzo Word ID series on the screen."
That's how we built it.
(Applause) There are a lot of things like this.
One of the ways that the prisoner's source was to write a letter to a letter.
CA: You also have BP-A data?
JA: Yeah, but it's also very, very much — we're working in the fungi for counting now, and the engineers are doing it.
And because we've been working for the last few months to help protect our public concerns, we've been reducing NGOs in order to redefine the fundamentalities of counts.
That's a little problem.
The other kind of organization that's beginning with new activity is giving us a lot of challenges, and we don't have enough workers to store all of these data, even though it's already more information.
CA: So what you've got to do is you've got the main Teachers and/Axud journalists who are willing to give you a job?
JA: Yeah. And we believe it.
It's hard to develop because the data that we have in our hands are made in a little bit different, and we need people who can deal with high levels of security, and they can do it with security issues.
CA: So why would you tell me why it started?
Now, I didn't know that it had changed 37 schools in your childhood.
Is that true?
JA: My parents were in a film business, and my religious ceremony was the result of the two.
(Laughter) CA: Now, we've been surprised to say that this is the parania sources of prison.
JA: What do you think of business?
(Laughter) (Applause) CA: So I don't know that you're a young age, but you're also a square, a picture of it.
JA: I was a JA: I was a Jurmian.
I was a young journalist in the Aristotle.
I was arrested because of the story that I had made in young people.
We need to treat Xakers a little bit.
With the Xarker path, we can do different things.
Unfortunately, most of the cases, for the Russell of the Russell, the grandmother's grandmother, they're working with the money in the bank.
It's not like the Xarker seller before.
CA: I don't think you've got to do your grandmother's money. What are the values worth it?
If you can give a little bit of information about them, or why would you talk about things that created them or created them?
JA: Well, I think it's an event.
But I think the basic values are that people don't create skills and wisdom; they help victims.
And that's what my father had learned from people like my father, my father, my father.
CA: It's bright, it doesn't create a human building; it's a lover?
JA: I'm not a little drummer, I don't just show them as a gorilla, but in a way — I mean, I'm a buildingor by the people we're doing.
This is a picture that I've been with for a long time.
CA: Can you talk a few minutes about what's happening in Nigeria?
And there's a contract that's led to the bank, and it's led to the news news, and it's led to surveillance.
Instead, it's popular.
You created a great invention in Iceland, and then what happened?
JA: That was a big issue.
It was the economic bumbleble in Nigeria.
It was one of the biggest breeze in the world.
Ten times from my bank sector, the product that was actually happening on the other beaches was already 10 times.
We published this information last year in the Idul.
"It was about five years before the release of the story, and as in the movie, the case of prosecutions had been prosecuted, five of the news of prosecution had begun, and it didn't happen, and it didn't happen, and it didn't happen, "Would we be now?""
We were publishing news instead of news, and we were quite popular in Nigeria, and we even talked about the issue.
Everybody in the community knew that we were not going to be able to do it again, but as a few of them, a new project of laws that were going to be the governors of the politicians and international nations in Spain to protect jets of jusnisans, and one of the most fundamental laws in the world to serve laws of law, which is that it's because of the law, it's the law that's the law that's the law that's in order to protect journalists.
Nigeria, in Norse, had known as the scanner to enter the system of other country countries.
And one month ago, this law was hidden in the Islamic parliament.
CA: Wouououou.
(Applause) My recent question is Judan.
What would you believe in the future? How would you imagine that the Big Brother will be able to control everything, or whether people will watch the Big Brother surveillance, or what else?
JA: I'm not quite sure how I could be.
All over the world — all over the world, like the U.S. and the U.S., there's a lot of freedom and law enforcement going up.
It's hard to see what the future will be.
It's a very interesting period of time that we're living, and we can change everything.
CA: Well, I feel like I'm telling your people what you're saying, you know, you're in love with yourself, you're in charge.
JA: Thank you very much, Chris. (CA: Thank you.) (Applause)
I'm a writer.
"It's my job to tell a story and write a novel. I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the story, and I'm going to tell you a little bit about what's called ""the,"" and what's called the movie."
But let's take the first time to begin with this, and tell you a little bit about my personal story.
I'm going to use words, and I'm going to use a geometry, and you're going to see a few circles when they're talking about each other.
In Straggurqa, Franka was born in Turkey.
And soon after that, my parents have divorced, and I've come to Turkey with my mother.
Since then, I've been fascinated alone in our life as a child.
In the 1970s, it was a little strange.
Most of the families in our neighborhood were the big families of the horses of the horsal, the family of the family, and I grew up with my mother, the woman who had just divorced in the Patrixal environment.
Actually, I grew up with two groups of women.
On one side, it was beautiful, it was modern, it was tropical, it was Turki — my mother.
On the other hand, I always care about it, the rest of the conversation, the less health, the less health of the grandmother, the less likely my grandmother.
My grandmother, I'm sorry, in the morning, looking at God's eye, and he's able to bring the devil into a variety of different ways to make it look like this.
They're deep in their products, they've gone to visit the grandmother's village, people who've been wasteed in their hands.
Every single time my grandmother, my grandmother, would have planted in Arabic as much goldy as the waste of red on his hand.
And then a building would make fun of it.
A week later, he was a week for the last interview.
I know that science can sound so strange to talk about it in front of the brilliant people, but I'm not seeing people coming up next to the grandmother's team with various different kinds of documents for their jewelry jewelry, or none of them coming back to the right.
What did I say from my grandmother? What was the power of this stunt?
"He said, ""Well, of course, there's the power of prayers, but there's the power of basic apartments."" There's a lot of important lessons that I've learned from now, if you don't want to do anything in life, if you don't want to do it, whether it's the ones or the people's soul or the people's soul, it's going to take it to replace it with the thick walls."
It's almost going to be built inside.
Every one of us now is in the context of social and cultural.
We're all in it.
We're all born to a certain family, a ring, a synchrony.
But when we don't know how to connect with the outside world that we belong to, we're confronted with the golden rule when we're far away.
Our imagination may be diminished, and I'm sure that if we're too long in the environment, we'll lose our sense of human beings.
If our friends are familiar with our neighbors, our neighbors, our families, and they're similar to us, and they're very similar, and they're very similar to us, and they're kind of cool.
The women like my grandmother in Turkey are doing something like this, and they're spinning the next day with a piece of the mirror, or they're spinning it across the face of a sad day.
It's coming from the belief that exists on the far east, and it's not that a lot of people are looking forward.
And strangely, it's one of the world's greatest hazards that share similar ideas.
And that happens everywhere, between liberals and conservatives, and rich and poor people, and the West, and so on.
We form complex complex groups of locations and things, and we create steroids about others.
In my mind, the experience of writing may lead to the everydayness of these cultural icons.
If the boundaries can't distribute the boundaries, then the boundaries of our mind can also reveal the patterns of our bodies.
And by looking at these things, we can see other worlds, and we can even love what we see.
I started writing stories from my age eight.
And one day my mother told me that my own personal story would be a mess in the snow, and that would be a good idea to write my own stories here.
Now I'm trying to think that at that time, my thinking was a little bit scared about it.
My stories were good for my family at home, but it wasn't good for me to talk to people about stories.
I was a kid who was going to talk with big tips, and I was going to drink as much as I wanted the things that I touched, and I was an inchrovent kid, and my mother thought it was a good idea to write my everyday impulses.
But he didn't know that I was thinking that my life was so intense, and what I wanted to do was write about this amazing life.
Instead, I began to write about myself, not about other things, but about myself.
That's how I started a writer about environmental love.
People's lives, people's stories, people's lives, people's stories of others, for me writing.
So take a look: I'm going to take a look at it, and I'm going to tell you about it, and this is what happens with my life.
Another event happened in this audience.
My mother became the bottom tomato.
And I also went out of this little, middle-school environment, and became an international school district in Madrid, and I was the only Turkish in my school.
For the first time, I was able to realize that there were children who had been forced to say it as an excerpt outside, but in fact, all of these milliseconds had become the environment of the democracy that was going to be found out of this cosmopolis, and it was going to be the case that you could see it.
In fact, kids in this mesh are self-esteemed, not their own ones, but their lives themselves, but their lives.
We looked like the United States, and it was also fun, and it was bad for anyone to do, and it was bad for us to talk about.
And then the child becomes a magic reputation, and it's always gone down.
And I remember when I was in school, when I was in Turkey, the military became military-ownowned, the Turkish military bombing the Papi, and Eurviovioian music brought it to Turkey.
(Laughter) So I've been running out of the bench-stasy school for this time, thinking about becoming marine.
For the first time, I've seen a cultural stereotype in school in this school.
"All kids I'm not going to look at would ask you about ""Midig Extress."" They asked me, I've taken a few cigarettes every day, and they asked them, ""I've taken them all over the Turkey."" And they asked them, ""I'm going to show up my head."
I've learned here three style of Turkey: politics, cigarettes and covers.
After Spanish, we went back to German and again to the detection of Germany.
I thought that my imagination and my imagination could be the only trip I could carry with myself, all of these expeditions.
Stories gave me a sense of continuity, a sense of freedom and freedom — I was the poor, and I was in the real world.
I went to the city of Santul, where I love my 20s.
I lived in a very vicious environment, and I lived in a live environment, and I wrote a patch of my novels here.
When I was in the earthquake in 1999, I was there when I was there in the earthquake.
It's based on me on what I saw when I was coming out of a school in three years.
He had an old seller, an old seller, and he didn't sell it in the store, and he didn't talk to the edges and the medjinian lives.
At first, there was a long black black, periphery in the eye, and there was a lot of transmission.
I've seen a lot of jewelry offering him from cigarette cigarette cigarettes that's taken out of their pockets, and that's what I'm going to see next to you here in the world — and it's a cigarette of transgressor that's crying with a conservation seller and a silver.
When we're confronted with death and wreck, what we're seeing is the difference, and that's what we're seeing, even though we're all doing for a few hours.
And I always believed that stories had similar effects.
I don't really want to say that the magic is as powerful as a earthquake, but when you read a good novel, it goes away from our own little comfortable room, we start to recognize people that we can't have time in the snow of the night, sometimes we don't have a good idea about it.
And after that, I went to college with girls from Boston, and I went to Switzerland.
It's not just geographical, it's a complete change from the language look.
I started writing English.
I'm going to go to the president, and my immigrant, and they ask me why I write English, and it's helping me change my writing language, and it's helping me change my mind.
I love being able to write in Turkey, and what I write is more synthetic, and I like to write in English, and I think it's more mathematical and logical.
I think every question is different.
I've learned that English is a million people in the world, and I've learned later that English is a language of gas later.
When you learn learning about the language later, you're almost as if you don't want to lose the learning.
And as they come back later, we want to do better words, we want to do better words, we're less advising each other, because the difference between our brains and our language is big.
It's a misconception.
But when we learn to be afraid of it, it may be worth us.
That's what I learned in the Boston — it was a wreck and a steady style that I lived with.
In the past time, my grandmother, who's watching all my work as much as I'm concerned about my day, and I've been able to go home with the everyday prayers, and I've been in a place where he's going to go through the idea, but after he's coming back, I've been in a place where he's going.
I grew up my family because my grandmother loved it.
(Laughter) But instead of trying to make a decision together, I went to Arizona.
And because my life was on the Santanbul, I went and went and went between Arrion Stanbul, and I couldn't feel as much as I could have felt about the difference in the world.
I was always thinking about a part of me moving back to the house, looking at the physical and soul.
My stories are always coming to me to keep my lives and pieces of mine.
And I'm trying to figure out that when the story comes to a much more real connection than the story, it makes that magic.
I'd like to give you an idea of this issue.
One of the projects that I wrote in English is that when we see the light in America, one of the people in America, one of the great equations has made such a blessing.
"He said, ""I like that."" He said, "It's a little bit different.""
(Laughter) I asked him what he wanted.
"He said, ""Well, let's look at you, there's a lot of Spanishes, but there's one Thursday characters, and there's one guy."" In fact, Boston University camping in college, he was a phenomenon that made me realize that there's more than a lot of other milliseconds than the Turks, but it's because I'm trying to understand what the Bible meant to be. But I'm trying to understand."
But I know I'm always going to make it sad.
He wanted it to be my personal manual.
He wanted to be a Nigerian woman in the book because I was a Nigerian woman.
I'm always talking about the way stories change the world, and we can see that the politics influence the way things are spreading, the way things are affected by nature, the way it works, the way it works, the way it works.
Most of the writers, especially the authors who are illiterate, don't listen to it.
If you're women like me from the Islamic world, they're expecting you to write about Islam women, it's not a woman who is not happy.
They expect you to write more intelligent, sad, different kinds of stories, noisy, no matter whether you're going to be remote from the West's hunting.
In Madrid, while I was growing up, there are many of the world's literature that I've seen in Madrid.
The authors look like the creators of their own ideas, not as the creator of their civilization and our country, but a few authors from China, a few of them from Tabisia.
They're expecting not to be different, but to be fit into our culture.
In 1984, when a writer and a traveler, James Ballw, they asked him a couple of times about homosexuality.
"Some of you who brought it to a blue writer, Ballwin based on the blue writer, and he said, ""You know, I don't have anything else?"" And what I've had is the same with every other person I've ever had."" When I've labeled the code, it's under danger of our liberty."
There is a very uncertain trivia that all of the writers who are not Western, and that's what's called literature that's not Western.
About 10 years ago, I remember reading some of the first few people in Harvard Money.
We had three writers, one of the people from the Falifty, one in Turkey, one of the Indonesia Sea, and one of the Indonesia.
(Laughter) But what we're going to do is we're not going to see the magic or the intimacy that we're putting together.
We only had passets.
The authors of the writing that have come from other miles are waiting to write real stories.
It's happening in a very specific way.
And in this way, it's not just writing, it's a mass of characters, but it's a mass of characters.
Well, I'm not going to tell you that the story isn't going to be on the West, but it's not going to be true.
That's what it is all around the world.
I saw this first time in 2006 because of the words of my comic characters in my life.
I started writing a lot about the public's family of women and women's eyes, and I wrote a lot of relief.
When I went to trial, my little story turned into a big printing press.
I went to write about the conflict of Turk-Saharan Fair, and some of them, and some of them, and some of them, they've done me.
But I'd like to say that in that moment, it's just literature.
Just a story.
"I just don't want to say ""The story,"" as I say, ""I don't want to say the value of what I'm seeing."
I'm surrounded by love and loving how to deal with the math, not because they're thinking about it.
The writers are known to see politics, but political books are enough, today, the language of literature is not language of everyday politics.
"Meaxov once said, ""All right things about solutions and things like solutions."
"And it's the work of an artist's artist."" Now, it's the work of an artist, and it's the thing that distinguishs us from each other. It's the collective."
There's one thing that makes them look like zero.
The second is the thick differences.
Somebody pulls the front.
The second is the boundaries.
I've been doing things that are fantastic.
In fact, it's a magic set of water.
"There were people who were telling stories of the story that were called ""The Buddhist."" And they'd say stories of people who were very often in the audience who were telling them about the story of the story that was happening."
They change their voices to express different textures on the story, mimic them.
It's what everybody's rational to listen to, even people who are simple, they're staggering, they're non-profit, they're non-profit.
The boundaries would have crossed. The Middle East, North Africa, Blanks, and the Molla River, as well as the Molla River.
And today, stories are continuing to cross boundaries.
I'm talking about Palestinian and Israelisian politics, but the Palestinian readers who are illiterate musicians, and the Palestinian readers, they also have a way of connecting the Palestinian printers to a story.
We've got to do our writing land more.
If it doesn't do that, it's not good work.
books have saved me from kids who have been scanning and embarrassing me over a period of time.
But there's a danger of making books.
After the author and the spirit path of the artist and my Sumass Termin, my first job was to watch him destroy him in the water, and he threw his book in the water.
"After all, ""It's much more unimaginable than you are."" Today, we know a lot about the problem of cultural icons and the lack of wisdom, and we think that we know more about one-one, that we know more correctly, that we're not going away from our knowledge, we're going to connect with ourselves, we're going to connect ourselves, we're not getting away from ourselves, we're not getting away from ourselves, we're not going to be connected."
There's a similar analogy that I love: live like a conspiracy.
One of the things that happens is that it's fixed.
The other thing is that it's happening, and yet it's all going on, and it's all going on.
That's what my work is.
And part of what I'm writing is that we're looking at Turkey, and part of what's happening is that it's connected to the world, and it's connected to different cultures.
And I think it's an understanding of my work, and I think it's an understanding of the public, and it's also a function of where it is, and it's everywhere.
What you're probably familiar with this expedition is that you've been surprised by the Topka Say, and it's been a result of the 1400-year-old rulers of the Osmanian slums.
There's a place in the middle of the village called Embraces in the village.
That's the place between buildings.
And I'm very interested in this approach.
We don't believe anywhere in the world, but we don't usually believe anywhere.
These places have evolved from the wild, and when we change, we think about the kind of randomness of what's symbolized as the symbol of the symbol of the destruction of the world.
But what I think artists have to do is I've got to sleep in the middle of my artists.
When I'm writing, I'm very interested in change, and I'm superior to change.
I love not to think about it after 10 pages.
I love my characters becoming a reminder of me.
In one of my romance, I'm going to talk about women, and there's going to be a great happy woman, and the next one would be the creation of the Norden bombsight, which is the creation of the Norden bombsight.
And as far as we can imagine, we can look at everything.
"Audo Lorde said, ""We're in the middle of our ancestors, and I'm saying, ""I'm walking down, and I'm saying, ""Well, I'm sorry, I'm less at it."" And I think it was a great example."
And I don't think it's because we're still teaching the writer, and it's like, you know, you know what the students know about.
Maybe it's not very good for the beginning.
It's not about who we are, what we know and how we are.
We need to teach each other to write about what we feel clearly about young people and young people.
We have to move away from the grounds, we have to recognize other worlds.
It's like the skin skin that draws circles of sand, hitting the cycles of time.
They're putting together all of the human beings together in the face of the market, and that's the good news.
"I'd like to end with my story with an ancient waterfall, and I'd say, ""You know, I'd like to be friendly, we're putting things on the road; love; the Earth is a world."" Thank you very much."
(Applause)
My big idea is a little idea that we can imagine millions of big ideas inside us.
I'm talking about this little idea.
(Laughter) (Applause) The women who are here with a group are women who are not sure.
The women are women.
And I realized that I was very hard to deal with the value of sleep.
Two and a half years ago, I lost a lot of worrying about it.
My head was hit by stolen, and I was humiliated, and I was struck by five building blocks on my right eye.
I started to realize that this is the value of life.
And then I studied doctors, scientists, and as a result, I can tell you, it's the only way to be more productive, the only way to be happy is to say normal.
(Applause) So, we're the women who are starting to deal with it.
I mean, it's just like we're going to be the most or the most.
(Laughter) (Applause) Because sadly, it's considered acceleration for men to say less or less.
More recently, when I was doing a man with one, he started talking about the next night he was lying at about four hours.
"I'm sure I'm going to say, ""You know, I'm going to say, you know."
"What would it be even more interesting if it were five hours?"" (Laughter) Most of the people lie less alert."
"I'm here to invite people to eat in the morning, like the Vlindon, and if you ask them, ""What is it like 8?"" And the great probability is, ""It's too late, but it's not nothing, it's a little tennis, it's going to call it somewhere."" They're going to say, ""You know, it's okay."" And I think it's okay, but I think it's okay, because the political and economic leaders are going to be as bad as the business as we're doing."
All right, I'm going to have an IQ.
Not to be a good leader, but to be a good leader, to see before we touch Titanic.
It's enough for us to give our passions to Titan.
I think that the Lhman Brothers, the great investment banking — if they were black and sisters, they would still be right.
(Applause) When the girls were doing 24 hours a day, seven hours a day, seven hours or eight hours of sleep, the mothers would see the moon, maybe it would be.
It's the best of all the world that we're facing, in a way that's benefited from our lives, to our lives, to our environment, to our health, to our impact.
One more single thing I'm showing you is the power of your eyes, your eyes, your devices, to see the big ideas inside you.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I was like a child who had a body of children.
If you think about the brain, the brain is made up of two parts of the brain.
Please donate me for a minute. Thank you very much. It was fun. (Laughter)
And the information that's energetic is spreading all of the systems of life, and it tells us how it looks, how it smells, how it feels, how it sounds, how it sounds, how it sounds.
We're an energy that's connected with energy, through the skin of our right brain, with the energy.
At this point, we're perfect, absolutely beautiful.
And part of the brain is a completely different place.
It thinks half of the Sun.
And our left brain is thinking about language.
The only thing I could do was I couldn't make it was the foreign energy — the power.
"And I said to myself, ""What did I see?"
I'm having a light in it. Have a look at it.
