When I was 11 years old, in one of our children, I remember walking around like my daughter's voice, watching our houses happy.
My father listened to the BBC news news in his little bosher radio.
In the product, there was a number of people who were not receiving at that time, because the news was over a lot of them.
"He said, ""Good was back!"" My father was winter."
I didn't know what that meant, but I could see how my father was happy.
"He said, ""Now, you can go to the actual school."" And he said, ""Well, my dad."
It was a morning that I could never forget.
The actual school is going to go to school.
When I went to Afghanistan for girls, I was six years old when there was no school for girls.
So for the next five years, I had to wear my siblings as a boy to go out and go out and go to school as if they were all alone.
We were the only way to know whether or not we were going to get education.
We've come from a different way every single day that nobody knows where we're going.
We would bend our books to market tunas, just to say that we're not familiar with.
In a school school, 100 of them are already in a school like a man in a small hole.
It was comfortable during the winter, but it would be cool in the spring.
We knew that teachers, students and parents, we were all in the danger of our lives.
Sometimes, because Tal was so sad, she used to have a week of school.
We were always afraid of what we knew about our rights.
Now, don't they see us?
Are they aware of where we are?
We were horrified, but again, the school, the place we wanted to be.
I was actually very lucky, because I grew up with a family that gave birth to education and gave her girls a chance to go to one another.
My father was a remarkable human being, in essence.
He insisted that Afghanistan had a different idea, a girl, a girl, a girl, a mother, a school, and therefore his father, his father, was defeated by his father.
But my mother, who had seen education, became a teacher.
It's it.
Two years ago, she swallowed our house, and she had a school for women and girls inhabit our neighbor.
And that's my father — that's — he's the first one he's ever trained in his family.
She didn't know if she was going to get girls to school, but even though she was in the danger of the Taliban, she went to risk.
And for her, their children were more dangerous to get education.
I remember thinking about it in the Taliban years, and it would have been a time, and I would always hope that we don't see light from our lives, and I would always hope that we don't see a light from the future.
"I'm sorry to all of us. My father says, ""Listen, my daughter, my daughter, you can lose anything in our life."
It can be stepped off. You can put it in numbers, and then you can put it in order to leave the house.
But the only thing that's going to happen with you is there, and if you sell our blood to pay for your school spending, we sell it to school, and we'll send you to school.
"Now, you know, do you still keep doing it?"" I'm 22 years old today."
I grew up in a country that was distributed across the wars that were going on for decades.
Ninety-five percent of my life, but less than six percent of my schools, and if my family had never been looking for it, I couldn't do it.
Instead, I'm standing here in front of you, and I'm standing in front of you with a Mumbury Code.
(Applause) When we went back to the mosque, one of the first people who was congratulating me was my leg because she was sending her daughter to school.
He's not because I'm graduate, but because I'm also the first woman to move her to the car in the Kulmobile, but because I'm a woman who's carrying her.
(Applause) My parents believe me.
I've got a lot of dreams, and the stories of my family are bigger for me.
So, I'm a global campaign called 10x10 in women's education, a global campaign.
And that's because women's school is still risky in a country where women are in Afghanistan, the SOLA, the first-long school in Afghanistan.
And that's the most glimpse, which is, I see students with partnership with opportunities in my school.
And I see how they support their parents, their ancestors, my father, even though they come to me, and they support their daughters.
I didn't think that's because I didn't tell you that his face and his real name, but he's the father of one of my students.
About a month ago, when her daughter came to the village village with SOLA-E, she took them for a few minutes before she died on the road.
She played the phone on the roof, and the voice on the phone would continue to send her to school, while she was going to continue to go back to school, she was able to work with what we're going to be doing.
"And he said, ""If you're going to kill me now,"" he said, ""I'm not going to protect my girl future, and I'm not going to protect you with the old ideas that are going to come back."" And what I've discovered about the Brazilian future is that sometimes it's a success that's been observed by Westerners — that success is based on the success of every girl behind us."
That doesn't mean that our main successes aren't hungry.
In fact, their ancestors are very important to persuade the bright future of their daughters, but in a community like this one, the men in a community, the women's lab, the women's lives.
The girls who went to school had a few hundred measurements — as you know, it was destroyed by a flower.
And right now, girls in Afghanistan are more than three million girls.
(Applause) Afghanistan looks very different from the United States.
I understand that Americans see unrelatedities in the United States.
I'm afraid that these changes are not going to take too long after the U.S. was destroyed.
But when I come back to Afghanistan, when kids and parents who are encouraged to support them, I believe that there's a light future and a change that's going to happen all the time.
For me, there are many of the opportunities in Afghanistan and of the unpleasant possibilities of Afghanistan, and the girls of SOLA-Aeda are getting it to me every day.
And they accumulate great dreams like me.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
It's in every branch that admits exactly what it means.
There's objection on the ark.
It doesn't stop. Let's go back.
One. Two. Three.
We can't see if we're going to hit the first public.
If anything had been illiterate about it.
And I was so lucky to escape, because I was so fortunate that a lot of North Korea had not been so lucky.
He learned a new language, and after he got a job, all his life could be sub-simmerged.
We were all Korean, but after six7 years of fragmentation, we were all in Korea.
I'm South Korea, or is North Korea Korea?
So I started planning about how to save them.
I'll never know anybody.
That's the picture of my life.
This is the magic that we designed in 2007.
We've built it into workshops.
It's going to hit the surface of the building, and it's going to hit the surface of the building.
If you're a kid, you probably know that kids love to brush.
This is what the building looks like.
Why did we build that?
"And he said to me, ""I don't want people to be."" And he said, ""I don't want them to be."
"And I said to him, ""It's not possible."" But he insisted, ""Well, what if we were to crocodile from the edge of my life?"
"The kids bring down."" (Laughter) I said, ""That's OK."" And of course, the government's workers said, ""Well, they should be absolute."
We did this idea, but we did it around the trees.
There are three trees inside the building.
They allowed us to name these scores as well.
But it's used for all other purposes.
They're projected on the tuna.
And the kids, you know, they're doing it, and the kids are doing it.
(Laughter) Sometimes a tree builds up close to four children around the ocean.
This boy, you see here on theq, loves the tree so much that he loves it.
(Laughter) Every time they're taught, they're sitting behind the roof.
This flower looks very fresh from the ground.
They look like bpoopar fruits.
(Laughter) It's time for me.
(Laughter) (Applause) We've done my life as low as possible, and we're going to see kids not just below the roof, but on the side.
It's going to be very high-speed, but it's going to see tastes.
And that's where you eat legs — there's all kinds of water crystals.
You see, it's the kind of person who wants to water their friends in Bornar children, and that's the norm.
But what you're seeing is that the boy loses his claws, and he's making them fill with water.
(Laughter) Over the last year, it's been completely open.
There was no sky inside and no desert.
And it means that the archetype of the archive is made out of the roof.
There's no skydiving between the classrooms.
They don't have problems.
Most of the kids don't move away, and they start to disgust.
But there's no reason why Mr.oza doesn't worry about it.
Because there's no sky here.
And he says that if he doesn't want to be in the corner of the room, then he can go back and go to the room.
It's a shade ridge, and it's going to come back wherever it is.
(Laughter) I mean, kids don't like to hide.
And here they go and come back again.
And that's natural.
Second, we think it's important to have sound-walk.
You know, kids are getting better at sound.
They're sitting there, and they don't lie there.
Our kids in the Gulf have a high-speed migration.
You know, our ancestors grew up in the sound-of-the-art, you know.
They need to sound for them.
And you also know that you can't talk to your friends, and you can't easily talk to them.
You don't have to be transparent.
You know, in our cases, we're not trying to control anything.
And that's OK.
It's true that we've been going to go down in winter in 10 degrees of cold.
And we're looking for grapes on the spread.
The sun is getting sunburned in 50 degrees.
We don't have water.
We're not having a husband on rain.
So we evolved to become a flag.
And that's what we should do with kids.
It's trying to divide the classroom.
They're actually going to help teachers.
But they don't.
(Laughter) And that kid is out there.
That's the classroom.
Here's the hand-wandering.
They're having a good conversation here.
There are many trees in those places.
The fruit on the ground is trying to keep the fruit on the top.
(Laughter) More fruit. (Laughter)
Every classroom room room room, you don't have a glass at all.
Santa Claus also comes from a mill.
And that's a building that's built right next to the circular.
They're up to five meters in the room, and they're very free.
We're very low.
We need to have a sense of safeness.
We let a girl let a boy go for you.
They're trying to get inside.
It's a big deal.
Well, it's fine, but it's happy to do it.
It's powerful. It's my son.
(Laughter) So here, he looks at how safe he's going to get out of the trees.
And then we left the other kids inside.
You know, I'm very pleased in Tkoki.
(Laughter) She's trying to learn how to drive in the morning.
Now, there's a little bit of danger to the kids.
So they're learning how to help each other.
It's a community, and we'll hand these kinds of possibilities.
This picture shows a boy moving from the 17th century to 930, from the 1960s to 1730s.
It's 183 meters tall.
It's not too young.
So, this little morning, this morning, it's six,000 feet.
But it's still pretty interesting.
These kids are moving about 4,000 meters a day.
The kids here have the highest athletic display between the bonds.
"And my mind always says, ""I don't know how to do them. I don't use them."
"We'll drop it on."" (Laughter) They're running for their essence. (Laughter)"
I think we don't need to control them and protect them very much, but they need to bring them down.
They've got to get a little bit of a Ph.D. Royal.
Because it's going to teach them how to live in life.
I thought that architecture can change the world and the lives of people.
This is one of the steps that children can change their lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In the 1970s, I was busy in the Hubai city of China for two years.
I had a suggestion that all of the money that I'm going to go to school in the first grade was going to pay by the government.
"But my mother said, ""Yox."" And my parents wanted me to be an engineer like them."
And from the distance, I felt that after the Inqabab, it was the only way that we were dealing with good income and safe work, it was the only way that they were living.
It doesn't matter if I don't like my work.
But my dream was to be China's autonomy.
This is how I play the piano.
I wanted to be involved in being a kind of young age, and I made my hand to go to that opera school.
I even wrote a letter to make our school school school show.
But I didn't like my idea.
Nobody believes that I'm not particularly alive.
But my friends would support me, and they would be like me, and they'd be unpowered kids.
So, when I was 15 years old, I realized that it was night to work.
My wish never happened.
I was afraid that I was going to get my second grade of happiness in my life, just like the end of my life.
But that was injustice.
I decided to do something else.
Nobody's going to tell me what it's going to do? There's no reason.
I applied books to books.
"I read this book by the musician family who was asking him to take his advice. [""Fou Lei's family's family.""] (Laughter) And I took the women's support model from the women's women's friendship, and I took the women's women from the women's women's friends from the women's friendship model from this one. [""Jenastic."" (Laughter) I learned to learn from this book, ""It's cheaper. It's cheaper to do it.""] It's a book that's really to try to read me out the book."
"[""Sanmao's experience meeting""] [""The Children's name is Echo Chan] [The Children's Service's teaches go out of the Huaijin"" written: What did I read when I came to the United States in 1995?"
Of course, they were not able to do it.
"He's talking about the life of ""The Wild Tun"" village."
There's no use for your car. I can see it all the time.
The Bible is interesting. It's a little strange.
(Laughter) That's the other day.
"But my fifth brother gave me illumination, and it said, ""You're going to respect Dad and you're going to respect your father."
"And I thought, ""Let's see it differently and better."" So I've been able to redefine my parent's responsibility in Confuti, which is the kind of guiltyness in the Constitution, and I've had the chance to redefine my children."
And it allowed me to compare what I read with a new civilization.
This may teach you a lot.
For example, this map looked strange to me at the first time, because in China, we're growing up doing this map.
I never thought that China would not be in the middle of the world.
In fact, the map shows the world looking at it.
It's not something new about success.
This is a standard practice in the world of science.
In fact, there's also science here, like science fiction and non-disciplinary literature.
Teaching and against scientists helps us understand what's going on.
And I thought, well, if it worked for exploration, why don't it be alive in everyday life?
So, I started reading books in a dictionary.
"The same thing is, the people who attended the same event, [Benjamin Franklin] [Jo Walter Isaacon] writer ""Jo Maculloukh"": David MacCulloukh, and whether it's the same part of the universe, it's about friends."
"[""The StoryCorps""] [""The Katharine Graham] [The Karthope: The Warren Buff and Life"" writer: The Supice Schroy] I love one story to read a couple of jets — (Laughter) [The King Jamer StoryCorps] [Qoy: The King Jamaken'A:] The writer of Christopher Jeepo, in his wonderful stories, and it's the same as Jeep's ""The StoryCorps."" [""The StoryCorps'A: In the summer of New Jerussephorphorphorps's geography,"
For the prophet, these were economic, political and spiritual for the prophet.
And what's interesting about this work is that these were all psychology: urgency, fear and sociality.
It's interesting that if you know the English language, the books you love, they read two languages.
"[""Chhuang Tuzuk: Thamamo Merton]""] Sure: The Sue"" writer: The Shanghan Wats""] I found other interesting things that didn't happen, but I found other interesting things."
"Now, I realized that I had the translation of translations, which is the letter of happiness in China that says, "It's so delicate.""
"It's called ""the mother."" Yes!"
(Laughter) I've been playing a magic palace role in the past and with people in our times.
I know I'm never alone or weak.
We can't talk about how many other people can't happen to you, compared to the difficulties of the future.
I started to believe that the only purpose of the desire is not to happen.
The purpose of the wish is that aspirations and aspirations are helping us to connect with the point that happiness has evolved.
The desirable desire can also be able to do that.
Because of my books, I'm here today, and I'm happy, and I live in a very time with a light purpose.
"I'm telling you, ""Thank you all!"" I'm telling you."
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
You wouldn't forget it. We wouldn't do it.
"And then you're going to see it in your personal room and ask, ""Why is it my style?"" Well, you're on the morning and you're in the office. And then you're suddenly seeing the meeting."
And I'm talking about something much more valuable than office.
It's your age on the side of the mountain.
(Laughter) And before I think about it, it's to make it feel like the most extraordinary meeting meeting of the Sunday. (Laughter)
"It's a great reputation — click, click, click, click, cheetleat — long after you say, ""I've got to go, I've done night."" (Laughter) The sounds) It's important, right?"
It's a success for every company.
And a meeting that might be able to make a really good deal when they're going well.
So we're in the meantime. (Laughter) And the reason for that is not because this guy can't have a good meeting, DRS, but it's DRS, and it's what we've created, and it's what we've created.
In fact, I have evidence that DRS-in is the global episode.
So let's tell you about it.
So a few years ago, I put a video on YouTube, and I made all kinds of bad things that you could have on this video.
And that's about five-minute video meetings that we've loved about all of these bad meetings.
This is the head of the meeting surveillance that can be run by surveillance.
They don't know what they're doing.
And everybody left his nose in a very angry way.
It's about having to laugh.
(Laughter) Let's go quickly.
(Video) That's a very important issue in our village.
Hi, Joe — I'm working in the house today.
(Laughter) Hi, Joe. Thank you for the sorrow.
As a group of — listen frozen — (Laughter) Hello, who's joined up?
No? He looked at me. (Laughter) I'm talking about it.
Yes, it comes to me.
A few weeks after they put this on YouTube, 500,000 people in the country, literally, looked at this video.
And then three years later, this video takes a look at the mines every month.
Even though they're not able to see, they're laughing when they hear the person's voice.
"I'm my Maykl Shaker. I'm the leading community of Skepps, ""Skeppi,"" which is a community society."
We're looking at paranormal phenomena, curiosity and peculiar phenomena, and they're looking at things that are related to these groups, science, noddo-melm, unnecessary, unnecessary science, vu-melm, etc., science, bad science and science.
And if we've lived on Mars for the past time, then you've encountered a counter-intelligence of things like this.
Some of them actually call us a cularette.
But let's suppose there's a lot of things.
Who we're going to launch the Indian government, we're going to build them, we're going to build them, and the bad ideas are Ralph Nyud, who we are. (Laughter) We want to change the bad ideas with the great ideas.
Let me show you an example of the bad idea.
I've brought it in myself. We've made it to try NBC Date.
"It's a product of a Queadro company in Vircia."
"It's called ""Quadro"" 2,000 Ages."
(Laughter) They sold it for 900 dollars in school management.
And Radio Shacken is something that's very smooth.
You can use it to look for a lot of stuff, but it's something that you're looking for in a student's classrooms.
(Laughter) So this is the work: If you're moving around with this, you're going to go up to the other side, you're going to open up the diagram.
This is what it looks like.
I'm going to show you.
(Laughter) Hmm. This is the tendency to go back to a few lines.
We're going to experiment again because we're looking at this science.
I'm sure it's going to go on the ground.
(Laughter) Now, you can't laugh at it. (Laughter) You can't shake your pockets.
And the question, of course, is this: Is this a tool that's found that it's a symbol?
And the answer is this: yes, if you open up the hat, you find it.
(Laughter) (Applause) We're going to see not just what we've found but what we've found, but what we don't know.
And that's what I'm going to talk about here, and it's probably this: Estraces, asthologists, and they're always using it.
People remember what they've found, they're learning to tap.
We've done everything. We've done randomly compare it to the number of non-profit tapirs.
And here we did.
So we took two boxes, and we put one of the foundations of THC on the front, and then we put one of them blank.
And 50 percent of the experiments have been successful. (Laughter) And in the wild, we'll get this result.
This was an interesting little example of what we were doing.
"""Skepicch"" published a paper in three months, and each other happens."
This is about the future of consciousness.
And as people look, people don't mind?
Now, I have a clear idea of what I'm thinking about, and that's what it looks like, as people think about it, they're mindful.
Every 10 years, average IQ increases number 3.
And it's interesting.
Don't think of Skepishism or science funding.
Hmm and religion long?
It's like asking a science fiction map.
These are two different things.
It's not incremental, it's activity.
It's a way of thinking about things.
It's the way we're looking for nature for all of the specimens.
"What's more real? What's more real? When we're around the world, intelligence, intelligence, high-dimensional existence, farther away from another galaxy, the fact that the fermer Bobobun Kanzas actually belonged to an ad?"
"Actually, one of the readers read ""Skepputics"" did this with the Photoshop?"
And the question is, well, the question is — (Laughter) is, what's more real?
We have to be able to make sure that we don't know whatsoever, before we knew what was happening to the world.
"What's more real about it?"" What if the Arnold Weeky News didn't get an alienation to have an oscillator?"" Doesn't it happen?"
(Laughter) These things, like this, were the essence of Sydney Harrisis.
"I read it for those who sit there, and I said, ""Sonra gives you a wonderful title."
"I've got to tell you a little bit better about your second battery."" This slide destroys all intelligent design arangum."
That's what this darkness is doing.
(Applause) You might say BASERERR, but that doesn't mean anything. It puts an idea in the middle.
It's not going to happen.
And that's the end of the discovery of the creation of design.
"The scientists say, ""Well, you're a kiss, sometimes it's called ""the dark energy, the dark matter."" And they say, ""Well, what's wrong with it."
This is the beginning of the logical glass for science.
And that's because of the original design, TRFARLOI, and that's the end-of-the-box ring.
But it's the same question. What's more real?
The UFOs are an alien automobile, or is it that they're not able to do anything that they're going to do?
This is a picture of UFO from my home in Alberta California.
Doesn't it look like screwing in the door? Because it's like you're going to get locked up.
There's no Photoshop, no computer computer.
"I photographed this image with ""The Instamptics"" in the media."
Somebody's got a door in your hand.
The camera was ready — that's it.
(Laughter) And you might think that some of them are real, even though they're in love, or in conjunction, some of them are out there, but there's a great probability that they keep.
If we take more general, we're always looking at the difference between observations and theme in science.
For example, there were two problems with the telescope of the Galili that Saturn had with us.
First, the planet had nothing to do about rings.
Second, hold the observes and we're happy, and therefore, it didn't really understand what it was seeing.
"This is what they saw: "I've observed that the distant planet has created three pounds.""
They decided it was happening.
So, without the good planet rings, you can't form good contact with the right planets, without the rings.
That's what it was like when it was 1655.
This is a page of the book that Christian Huygens, who tried to figure out how to deal with the Court.
There were these two things to the Huygens, and there was a good theme about the rings of the planet and the solar system, and there was more precise telescopes available, so we knew that the Kepler was blowing faster than Saturn.
We knew about the edge of the telescope with this telescope.
And that proved the theme.
The bad thing about the theory is that science fiction is full of facts.
And one of the reasons why we've been able to believe in people is that we've only understood what's going on, and then I'm going to give you a lot of serious reasons.
We've made habits everywhere.
This is the grape on Mars.
In 1977, NASA was a photograph of the same place as NASA, and people thought it was the alibi that was created by conservatives.
Here's a picture taken close by 2001.
If you break it down, you can break it down again.
If you look at your eyes, you're going to turn your visual image into a more accurate image, so you reduce the quality of information.
And I'm sorry that you should look at the cave, because we evolved and evolved to recognize the grapes.
The products matter to us in a social way.
And of course, laughs. It's easy to see all kinds of grapes.
Here you see the smile on Mars.
(Laughter) If Astronomics were born, they could see Kermiti.
Here you go. See the little building mouths?
Or if geologists had elephants.
They're iconic.
(Laughter) In 1996, the farmer was in Tenessee.
He took five dollars from people who wanted to see a priest, from the Rahatus to the Tunisia and the Rahilia.
Here's Guillape and Watsonville, and it's smaller. No, it's smaller?
And that's pretty cool to work with, because there's a pattern, a network-built, a network-built, and there's a network-barque jewelry, and in effect, people are animals that are looking at these pictures — and they're animals that are looking at them.
This is at the end of the window in São Paulo, and I'm on the side of the window.
Here's a show of a show of cheese on the side of Las Vegas, and I've known it to be in the jazz in the jar. Yes, it's the United States.
(Laughter) The winner eBay — 200 dollars a year to buy it from this year. (Laughter)
Now, wouldn't it look like me? Did I have the date? (Laughter)
It's been destroyed in the media, and it's a pause in the 1940s.
I'm on the streets of Clearwer Florida.
I've been myself to see this.
There were a lot of people.
With his handbags, he's a lot of faithful people who have lived in the trees with his arms.
And we were interested in more closely.
You know what the size is — this is Dawkins, I and it's great Randi, we're based on two and a half-time view of what's going on.
People respect for thousands of pounds.
We went and looked back to the back to figure out what was going on.
And then you've come up with this image, where you've got funds, and you've got a lot of money.
And this is a picture of me on the other side of the Bakaka. They started to make guns.
In any case, most of them may be a wonderful thing.
(Laughter) Now, this is really the god of the sky, or the Marge magnet? (Laughter)
So I'm going to close my talk with another example of this, and it's with the theory of gravity.
"There's a movie called ""Honey,"" and it's Maykl Kitton, talking to us about dead men."
When I think about the dead, it doesn't actually count the number of individuals.
It turns out everyone knows you're talking.
It's a question of dead people who are tough.
(Laughter) So, in this movie, these messages are hidden in electronic events.
I uploaded them from a county called ReverseSpeech.com.
This is the most popular one.
That's the same sound of that famous match.
(Goking) If there's a circle of green, it's not worrying.
It's the summer of the May Tune.
It's going to be time to change the way it's going to be.
Now, let's turn around. Can you hear the secret message here?
(Music) [Satan] [Satan] ... Hey.
(Music) What were you equal? Audience: Hey!
What about that? You've heard about the least thing.
Now I'm going to ask you what you have to do to the equity of your brain, and we're going to hear again.
I'm going to finish my story with a small, fresh and beautiful story.
"It's an organization that's ""Skepics"" non-profit."
We're looking for goodness where people are.
There's also a popular philanthropy in the U.K.
It's very popular in Britain; it's called the Katie Mlua.
It has a lot of really nice music.
"It was among the best five songs in 2005, and it was called ""qquzzi million bikees."" The story of love — the story of Brania Nora Jones — the boy she loved, even a million pounds."
There's a part in the words.
(Music) We're still 12 billion light years away. That's OK. Nobody can say it's true. But I can tell you that I'm going to be with you.
Spiker: All right. At least close numbers.
"And yet, this would be the six-year-old ""We're here."" (Laughter) So, my friend Simon Sing, is physical. It's a scientific book called the scientific slippet, and it's a book called ""the Great Party."" It's a scientific book, and it's a scientific book, and it's a basis for science to make sense."
"So in ""The Guardian"" he wrote a paper about the music of Katie — and he emphasizes that we know how far we are from the front of the border."
No 12, we're 13,7 billion light years away, and we're not thinking about it.
We know how fast it is, even though it's a small probability of error.
So, if it's not quite accurate, we can say that it's very close to a proper competition.
What you find is that after the paper of the summer, Katie calls it to it, and we say, I'm so shy, I'm a fierce of astronomers.
I had to keep in the bed. He also wrote his Mahatma.
So let me end my talk with this.
(Music) We're 13,7 billion light years from the front of the visible universe.
It may have been a process of error, but it's the closest number ever made.
And by requiring the information that we have in our hands, I'm going to predict that I'm always going to be with you.
(Laughter) But what about it?
(Applause)
In the 1980s, if you had a documentary in the Germanian book in Germany, you had to get it out of jail.
You had to read an example of a text text written in the Malkin.
And the government knew that all the writers were missing.
When they found a piece of paper that made a sense of mind, they found it very often.
And we've been thinking about what's happening in the Western West as an enormous amount of damage to the freeness of expression.
We wouldn't let it happen in our countries.
But in 2011 this day, every single single single single single single famous grocery store is a scanner, every single single page, you'll be able to see a straight line of pale blue dots that will be different from others that belongs to you and the musicians and differentiate from others.
This is the reality of today.
Nobody gets to do it.
This is an example of the technology of our government, and it's an example of what we're using to our citizens.
This problem is the first one of the three main online problems.
If you look at these problems, and you look at these problems, we see the cells online, where certain groups are involved.
These cells are three main groups.
First, online they're murderers.
It's like Dmmitri Golubov, a city of Ukraine, Ukraine.
And it's not very hard to understand why people who don't bother doing all sorts of copies online.
These guys are giving money.
They're online to get a lot of money out of the wise, and they're getting a lot of money.
In fact, we've seen millions of cells online, multimedia people.
This is Vladirir Tasst from the city of Ethiopia.
This is Alphed Gonzalzzz.
This is Stephen Wat.
This is Bjorn Sunin.
This is Matthew Anderson, and it's Al-Daouur, and you can also extend it.
These guys are going online, but they're doing this online, and we're doing it online, and they're using things like bankrupt viruses to put money out of our bank accounts, or they're using a computer that's going to be used online online, and they're trying to collect information from a computer that's used to go online, and then they're picking up a check-up data.
Two months ago, the U.S. secret service industry in this picture was frozen in the Switzerland bank, and when we were in the formation, there were 14,9 million U.S. dollars.
Nobody knows where Sam Jee is.
I think it's more than the real world, and I think it's possible that we're going to be able to make people online today.
And it obviously turns out that as you look at the weather, it gets worse.
In the future, most of the trivial trips are going to be online.
The second big group of cells that have been working on this is not money.
It may be a lack of ideas, a cause of trying to see them.
The groups like Anonymous have been growing up in the last year, and they've been starting to keep the main place in online cells.
I counted two of the main cells: women like Anonymous, who are women who are doing this work for money, who are women like women, who are women who are women who are women who are doing it for Anonymous, and for instance, they're government and governments.
Let's look at what happens with companies like DigiNotar.
This is an example of what the government is about when we're doing our own citizens.
DigiNotar was a Sertifatical author in Holland — more accurate — to do it.
Over the past year, they've gone to my online cell.
Someone had broken the system into their system.
And last week, when I arrived at the Dutch government in the next week, I asked them about this, and I asked them to believe that there was a death of human death that killed one of those people in the United States, DigiNot.
He said he believed it.
How can it be that people die when they've been attacked?
The DigiNotar online is the Sertifatical Center.
They sell Sertifatics.
What do they do with the Serifica?
If you have a Facebook page on Htttps, and you want to use SSL encryption series, like in the email, you need this sterile.
We use more of emails and similar services, but it's much more popular to service service like Iran, and the reporters in this country are using more than outside services like the G.C., because the reporters, like SSL encrypt it, will not be able to control the government.
But this surveillance is the external Sertifatics that propels services like this.
You can distribute the website of your students.
This is what happened to the DigiNotar company.
It's like Arabic, and it's like, what's happening in Missai?
In Mircle, in the April of 2011, the men who kept the center of the secret police, and when we looked at the minister, they were able to detect a lot of documentations.
"And among these papers, there was a whole bunch of things called ""FINFISHER."" And in this case, there was a German self-assembly account, and the government of Miris sold software and software to keep surveillance all of the tools in the countryside."
The government of Miri sold the government to 20,000 hunters.
The center of the corporation is just where we're here.
In short, Western governments provide Western governments with devices that allow them to control their citizens.
But Western governments are self-esteeming.
For example, a few weeks ago, there was a virus that they called the Germans of the United States, and this virus was designed by the German government to identify their citizens.
And if you're punished, you're all kind of happy, you're all listening to your phone.
And now it's more than that.
It's going to follow you with the Internet.
The government knows that you can use a computer to control all of your relationships, and they can listen to online, they know that they don't listen to your password, they're learning your password.
"And as I talk about these issues, a lot of people would say, ""Well, it's not a good job, but my citizen, who made a blood supply, does not have a lot of impact to me."
Why am I worried?
"I don't have anything to do with you."" But it's very nasty."
It's a condition of privacy.
It's not okay.
It's not based on the choice between security and KI.
It's a choice between freedom and surveillance.
And if 2011, we believe in our government, and we've signed up from our lawsuit this day, it's a good thing to do.
But can we believe our government in the future for the next 50 years?
And questions like this, and questions like this should be about the future that we're going to worry about in the next 50 years.
(Music) (Applause) Thank you very much for being here.
"And I'm saying, ""Thank you, thank you for being here,"" because I was 17 years in the show."
And I said, well, this was the first image of Washington DC, and I went to the 20th anniversary of the Earth's Day.
My son and friends have gathered up there to listen to me.
"I said, ""I'm glad I'm here."" My mother was jumping out of the audience and said, ""Halulia, Johnny."
(Laughter) Imagine your 17-year-old behavior, and the moment you're staying in, and so on, and so on and so on.
"And my father said to me, ""That's yak."" And I'll explain that."
I looked around, because I didn't know where my voice came from.
"I didn't equal my voice for about seven years, and I looked at my environment and said, "Who's the voice that I thought?""
And then I realized that I was a self and a laugh.
"And my father said, ""Oh yeah, that's a little bit more than a dökey,"" and I'm going to take you through this journey."
And yet, even though it's not possible that this is happening, it's happening to us.
I think it can be methane for our travels, and I want you to think about your journey.
My journey is headed over 1977, and I'm seeing two oil tanks in the Golden Gate, and then half a national national national is the Gulf of oil.
And they were so touched by me that I decided to use electric transportation tools.
That's a big thing to do.
And that was also a big thing for the Point Reyes Station, which I lived in Invernes, and it was a big thing for the Point Reyes Station, where there were 350 people living in the winter of seven years.
And I went back to this place, and I started walking around and people — they knew what happened.
"They asked me, ""John, what are you doing?"" And they said, ""I'm walking around for the environment?"" And they said, ""Well, that's what you're doing to make us shame, right?"
"You're still not saying, ""Don't make you bad."" Maybe they were quite right, and I thought, you know, I'd walk around and people would have helped me."
Because it's because we're all suffering from oil.
He was talking, and I was fighting people who were not fighting it.
I called my parents.
"And I said, ""I don't use cars."" And my father said, ""Well, what didn't do when you were 16 years old?"" (Laughter) I didn't know about the environment around that time."
They lived in Philadelphia.
"And I said to my mother, ""Well, I'm pretty lucky to see everything."" And he said, ""Well, if you're lucky enough, you don't need to do that, you don't need to do it."" And that's the answer."
So, in my 27-year birthday, I decided — because I took a lot of fights and I talked a lot about — I decided I'd based on consulting, but one day, I'm going to give a talk.
So, I did this.
When I wake up in the morning, I don't think about it.
And I wanted to tell you, this was a wonderful experience for me because, for the first time, I started to listen to these things.
And it made me think about what I was equal.
Because I've always been thinking, I've always been hearing people, and I've been listening to people, and when I hear people, I don't think they want to talk about what they want to talk about, I've never listened to them.
And when I started thinking about people, I started thinking about them and thinking about what I would say when I talk about them.
And then ...
So it ended up communicating.
And I really listened to that day.
And it was amazing for me, because I've understood that I didn't know anything about these years.
I was 27 years old, and I thought, well, I know everything.
But I didn't know.
So I've done this for the next day, and then I've done it again, and it's continually, and I've promised to say, well, I'm going to be fine because I've already started learning, and I need it.
So, I didn't talk about one year, and then I thought, well, maybe I've started to redefine some of the things that I've learned.
But it took 17 years to take this time.
In 17 years, I walked around in the pedestrian, and I also made a statement in the banking hall, and I also became involved in writing artists and journalism, trying to read books around the environment.
And I thought, I need education.
And I went to Ashland, Oregon, and they had software that were happening there in the environment.
It's 800 miles wide.
So I went back to the office, and what? What?
I showed you the ellos in the accident.
Oh, what do you want to read here?
What about the people?
We have a special software for you. They've done this.
And two years later, I ended up with the bush.
My father came to me, and he was looking at me.
"He said, ""My son, you know, we're doing prostitution with you, but we don't know what to do with this fish certificate."
"You can't drive, you can't consult, you've got to send it."" (Laughter) I've got to take my tea down, take my waist back and walk around again."
I came to Port Townd, Washington, where we were able to get trees out of the trees, and I drove it along the Puget Sudge, from Idaho to Washington and from there to Missula, Montula.
Two years ago, I was looking at Montana University, and I loved this scholarship.
It wouldn't be bad to stay here for two years.
(Laughter) And that's how it happened. I got two years of college, and they showed me a lot of help in the forest.
There are two stories for Montana.
The first is, when he came there, he ran out of money.
"They said, ""Don't worry about it."" He said, ""Come back to school."" He gave me 150 dollars, and he said, ""Get out of school for a school."
"Do you go to South America?"" And I said, ""Well, do you go to America?"" — Shakes and lakes, hocrology systems, South America."
So I did this.
"He came back to me and said, ""Oh, John, you don't know that he's going to go through a school for a lecture, and then you can take his office and use it in a school as a student."
And then we can let you out of all the professions that we can let them drop out of their courses.
"It's easy to take a show, and if we don't solve it, then I've got to go through the course of schooling, and then I've got to worry about it."" All right! They don't need it in the printing press."
It was great that they wanted to help me, and that was me.
They saw that I was very interested in the environment, and they were trying to help me along the way.
So in this process, I've been doing lessons without consulting.
For the first time, I had 13 students in my room.
So what I've got to do with their handcuffs is my name: John Frankis, I'm walking around in the pedestrian, and I've understood that it's not going to be more translating — that's the last lesson.
It's all about the students that are going around.
(Laughter) I can see that they don't go wrong with the memory, but I can see they're looking for a while.
And I didn't know if I didn't do them.
After two weeks, everyone was trying to enter our school.
And I learned a lot in this room — and we've made these kinds of gestures.
And everybody went to see what John was trying to say — I don't know, I think it's understanding that the trees are being destroyed. Yes, everyone's going to see the trees happening.
No, it's not. It's not — it's a use of hand.
You've got everybody with a hand.
You can help everybody else.
No, he's talking about governance in that election.
So, this was a discussion, and we were discussing it.
I'm taken back from this work, and I'm not saying, I'm moving away.
But what I learned was something that sometimes when I showed a marker, they made meaning that I wouldn't know, but I didn't mean it.
And I thought, if you're a teacher and you're teaching it, and if you don't learn it, then you don't teach it well.
So, I continued.
"My father and father said to me, ""We're doing prostitution with you, but then you know, he said, ""Well, you need to drive and drive."" And he said, ""Well, you need to drive and talk."
"What do you think to do with the Magistrian certificate?"" I took my drawing, and I went to Wisconsin University."
I spent two years talking about what was going on.
Nobody was interested in oil waste.
But something happened — Exxon's Beach.
And I was the only man in the U.S. writing about oil waste.
My father came again.
"He said, ""My son said, ""You don't know what they're saying, you don't use it, you don't consult it."
"My father said, ""You need to leave the equation, because you're making it work better."" (Laughter) I've got my tea again."
I took the banjo and sat down the coast of the east, and I swam my legs into the Atlantic Ocean for seven years and a day to do it.
And in the 1990s, I started to ski on the 20th anniversary of the Earth Day Day.
And so I've been using that image because it doesn't mean that when the trees fall to the surface, it doesn't have a man to hear about it, then it doesn't sound.
And I thank you for my family and my family, because they were equal to me.
And that's how we communicate.
And they taught me about listening — they were listening to me.
And that was the thing that he didn't have — he listened to each other.
We really need to listen to each other.
My journey continued.
"And my father said, ""That's yak."" And I didn't know it yet."
I've been working with the government of the government, and I've been watching the U.N., and I've never seen it.
I wrote the rules for the U.S. — the rules of oil coming out.
"20 years ago, if someone told me, "Jo, do you want to make a difference from nature?""
""Yes, I want to make a difference.""
"They'd say, ""Oh, you want to get a place in the car and you're going to get it down."" And a little bit later, they'd say, ""Oh yeah, that's cool."" (Laughter) You want to make a difference, you want to make a difference."
What about the Ax? How about it?
How do you make a difference between simple things that can't walk around and talk to them?
It's been wonderful about conservation.
"And after that — I said — I worked alone here — I said, ""It's okay, it's enough for me to see this work."" When we went back, I took it back to the Gulf of Karibi and I went to the Gulf of Venesue."
The key thing was — I'm going to tell you why I started talking to you.
I started talking about it, and I learned about the environment around it.
I've studied the environment in this environment where it works, but it's also an extraordinary level of activity.
And it was amazing — I learned about people, what we do, and how we do.
And it's not just trees and birds around the environment, and it's not just species that are dangerous, but it's changing our relationship to each other.
And if it's environmentally environmentally around us, then we're all looking around us, and we're all looking at us, and we're going to act against each other.
And that was the message that I wanted to get to.
"And I said, ""I'm going to go to this guy."" And I'm sitting on my back, and I'm sorry, I'm going to go back, and it's my subject, and I'm working on it — I went to Venessee and walked around."
That's the end of the story, and I realized that I wasn't using cars yet.
I've been running around El Doraado — this is a famous prisoner, a prisoner, a retailer, a Venesu, and I don't know what it was, because I didn't have anything to do with me.
"And as I went through the workshop, the monster grabbed me down — he said, ""Passope, papake."" And M11 was a little bit of a rainfall."
"And I looked at him — I said, ""Passty?"
I don't have to show you pasport, it's about my fence.
I left the U.N. government — Frankis and I left the world.
What does it have to do to me?
He came up with a huge challenge.
They didn't laugh me.
And what did I thank God because I was free, and I was free because I was free?
And after I made it to 150 miles, I realized that I'm pretty sure I'm walking around, and I'm in love with it.
I was in prison, and I had to escape it.
It was the prison that I didn't use each other for transportation tools.
How can we be?
I didn't know that when I started drawing, I wasn't sure that I was going to use cars.
But it turns out that I don't want to be happy with myself every day, but I'm not always trying to use my legs to make my decision.
I didn't have my mind of the U.N. government.
I didn't mind being a professor.
And so I realized that I only had other responsibilities for myself, and that I had to change.
You know, we can do that.
I had to change.
And I was scared of change, because I always used to go around and become ubiquitous.
Because I was a prison assignment that didn't want the end.
When I went to college, I didn't know who I was.
But I knew it was necessary.
I knew I needed to change, because that was the only way I was here today.
And I know that too often, we tap in a place where we want to stay ourselves all the time, but there are places where we can go.
And now we need to be in the archetype of our self that we have, and we need to be in the background of our own self, and we're going to be able to see where we're going to have new self.
And I'd like to be very interested in looking at where we're going to go next — where you're seeing yourself in the prison, where you're going to get it to where you're going from, and that's as comfortable as I might have been able to get out of the prison, and we've got to do things on this road.
We need to change now.
As President Vitse President said, we must be born.
And if my voice is affected to you, if it's affected by what I've experienced, then I want you to notice the impact that I'm here.
I know that when I'm here, you can all agree with me.
Let's go back to the world — let's take this love, this respect, this respect, this respect — here's a TED time coming to the world, and we're showing each other.
Because our environment is environmentally environmentally, and our behavior is our behavior, our behavior, our behavior around us.
So I'm grateful to tell you that I'm here, and I'm going to end my talk here with five seconds.
Thank you.
(Applause)
"You know, it's like, if you're walking around in America, it's closer to you, and asked, "Look, what's the name of the brochure?""
"And you say, ""That's the smallest part, and that's the little Elm."
"It's two-thirds, and he says, ""Right, what's the name of this broccupy?"" You say, ""It's not the name of the broccupies."
"Some of them have names, broccccoli is just a little bit of an index."" It's a little bit of grind, and it's a bit of a disappointment, and it's looking for you."
"Now, you can imagine that if you're standing up in the Yaponas, you're asking me, "Hey, what's the name of that little?""
"He says, ""It's 17 and it's 16."" And you say, ""Well, what's the name of the brochure?"" And he says, ""Well, what's the name of the small?"" And he says, ""Nothing don't name."
They have a name of boks.
Look at Google Maps. There's 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
They have all these names, and they're called, and there's a lot of things that are called boks.
"And you say, ""Well, how do you define your home?"" He says, ""That's easy. That's eighth Rayon."
"And this is the gentleman who asked, ""Well, it's OK. I watched him walk around and see him."" And he said, ""Well, they don't go through the home line."" And he said, ""Well, of course, they're going to go. The history that he built is common."
It's the number one in the first house to build in the block.
And then the number one is the number of builders.
"This can't happen. It's obvious."" And sometimes it's obvious, and I love it most, and I love it that because we're going to go to one side of the world to see what we've never thought about, to see the opposite of what we're going to be able to do right."
For example, doctors who have a Ph.D. think that their job is to keep you stable.
You're going to pay the doctors for months you don't pay, and if you're sick, you're not going to pay any money, because they're not sure that you're doing it because they're doing it, and they're doing it when you're robust, and you're sick, you're sick.
(Applause) In many music, we're accounting for the accelerator to start one. One, two, three.
But Western African music shows the end of a piece of music, like a sign that ended up at the end of a sentence.
So, you can see this not only in parts, but in count. Two, three, four, one.
And this map is true.
(Laughter) I've got to tell you that what you know about India is true.
So, if you ever have a great appreciation of how to forget, whether you're in TED or elsewhere, or if you've ever heard about it, it might be true.
Domo is an arigato glosehitia. (Applause) Thank you. Yaponica.
