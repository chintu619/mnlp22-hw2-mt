Today, I'm going to talk about unprecedented discoveries.
I'm working in the solar technology industry.
And my little start point is to turn ourselves around the power, and it's also ...
So let's look at different curves for that.
This is just a little video about what we're doing.
Oh, just a minute.
It can take a little bit of time to turn it down.
(Laughter) We're just — let's take that sense — I'm going to go beyond the feeling that's a video — (Laughter)
Right. (Laughter) (Laughter)
(Music) That's not ... (Laughter)
Okay. (Laughter)
The solar technology ...
Oh, was my time done?
Okay. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So I want you to focus on what you're doing.
We're going to go back to this in a few minutes, and I hope that if you learn to control your body if you're less, it will change your life dramatically.
We're very interested in the language of the body, and in particular, we're interested in the language of others.
Our ideas care about us: (Laughter) whether it's unleashing or laughter, unprecedented vision, or worrying, or something that's kind of like hand-blowing.
Audience: They're going to get closer to 10,000 homes.
This lucky police is the hand of the U.S. president.
We're wrong. We're collecting ourselves.
We get rid of it.
We're trying to be invisible for the man in our neighborhood.
As you can see, animals and humans still do the same thing.
And when it comes to power and power, it turns out that it's happening.
When we came to the sun, we were really willing to complete other people's work.
So if anybody has the power against us, we're trying to collect it. We're not going to measure his status.
Instead, we're going to be obsessed with his power.
I saw that MBA students are doing a lot of power courses.
Some of them look like leaders, and when they go into the school room, they go right in the middle of the ocean, and they're still sitting on them when they don't start the school.
They're about two people who are sitting there.
They put it in this way.
I made a couple of things for myself.
The first thing is, you know, it's not going to surprise you.
It turns out that it depends on murder.
So women are more likely to be subject to this law than men.
Women really feel less vulnerable than people, and that's not the surprise.
And it's very important for MBA students, because it affects their education benefits.
Education schools are always fighting gender differences.
The people and women who are preparing for the next year get different benefits at the end of the course, and it seems that it's associated with participation.
And I started thinking about myself, and let's see that people are more active in this way.
So if they show these videos, if they want them to look like this, would they be more active at the school?
So if we have a short period of time to show ourselves strong, can we feel stronger than we change our behavior?
Now, we know that our arts and our architects are determined by thinking and feeling about others about us, and that's a lot of depths.
But the question that really interests us is that architecture doesn't affect us.
That's what happens in both ways.
It's also about power.
When we feel strong and we feel stronger, we're going to be fruitful of a lot more powerful, but when we try to become strong, we feel strong.
What do I talk about when I think about the feeling of power?
I'm talking about ideas and emotions, and also physiological things that stimulate them, and I think these are hormones. I'm learning hormones.
What does it distinguish the minds of the weak with the forces?
But only 60 percent of the people in the power position, that's a pretty important difference.
And that's what we've shown in testosterone.
I've been 20 percent higher in the last year, and in the rest of the year, 10 percent higher in the education experience, and in others 10 percent higher.
We're going to have these changes in two minutes.
And these are the ones that are successful in cortizol.
It's about 25 percent higher in the cortizol of what's in the power position, and others 15 percent higher.
It takes two minutes to get these harmonical changes to make our brains feel more ambitious, more comfortable, more stressed and depressed.
These feelings meet all of us, right?
I mean, our language determines how we think and feel about ourselves, so non-verbal is not just for others.
The other thing that we have is changing our thinking.
The next question that's interested in us is that we can take a few minutes of power to change our lives in a significant amount.
This is a two-minute test that's started in the lab.
So can we do that in real life?
But that's what makes us really interested.
In fact, these positions can be used to be used to create social health issues.
Are we really going to be on the map?
It's the back of the food table for innovation.
For some people, these are school meetings.
It's an interview for others, or it's an interview, or it's an interview.
And we thought, well, it's interesting to many of you, because many of you have this experience.
"So we've documented our evidence, and the media has expanded them, and what the juscriminals say is, "Do we do that when we go to a business interview?""
(Laughter) Now, we rejected this idea. No! Absolutely no! We've never done it.
You don't understand that.
It's not with your other people.
It's your relationship with you.
What do you do before you start to start? Really.
You're sitting. You're looking at your iPhone or Android.
You're looking at your results, you're going to jump, you're going to collect yourself, and in fact, what you're going to do is that's like you're sitting on the foot, and you're going to stay right like that.
That's what we wanted to do.
They went to the lab, and they went back to the laboratory, and they went to a very, very cool business interview after we got a new position of strength and humility.
Five minutes of interview was taken to the video.
They were taught not to use them from a non-verbal tool to prevent the impact of the people who made it possible. They looked like this.
In five minutes, it's more difficult to look at the unpleasant face than to stay on the water.
Many don't like that.
"It's called "" stop in social poverty."" It increases the rate of cortizol in humans."
We took them from a comment like this to see things.
And then we showed them four of these pictures.
They weren't aware of our ancestors, our ancestors.
"They didn't know who was taking the paper, and after we looked at the video, they showed people who had a high-power position saying, "We want to take them off.""
"We don't want to take them to work."
"And the ancestors are more sophisticated."" What does it affect?"
That's not because of their essence.
It depends on what they're going to do to their nets.
We also looked at the other indicators of them, for example, how good are the indicators?
What qualities do they have?
There was no difference between these indicators.
That's not what's really important.
People just showed their real face.
So they put themselves out.
We don't take any sense of their ideas, they show them themselves.
That's how much it affects.
"And when I say to people that our body can change our thinking, our behavior, our behavior, our consequences, say, ""Is this not a little bit of saving?"" But I."
I'm not saying you're imitating it until it comes to reality.
"""I'm not like that."
I don't want to make life real and feel awkward.
I don't want to be a fake.
I don't want to be in a place that doesn't exist to me.
"I'm going to deal with this talk very well. I want to tell you a little story about being confused and feeling, ""I'm not my place.""
When I was 19 years old, I had a very heavy accident.
It's been shot in the desert from the automobile.
I've been turned around there a few times.
I was playing in the case of the hardness of the brain, and I had to leave the teacher, and I announced that my IQ level fell down to two indicators, which was very painful for me.
I was born, because I was recognized as a child who was a young and a child who was willing to be.
Because I was out of school, I was trying to go back.
"They said to me, ""You don't want to finish college."
"There's a lot of things you're going to know about it, but it's not college."" And I started to talk about it, and I'm going to say, ""You know, your basic properties, for me, were this anger, and nothing could hurt you as you got out of your hand."
I felt completely weak.
I worked, I worked, I worked in my face, and I won nothing.
I was just finished.
"I had to spend more than four years from my group colleagues, and Susan Karenini, who was a researcher, agreed to admit me to the University of Princeton, so I went to ""Where I wasn't.""
I was in the morning.
From my first course in Princeton for 20 minutes of listening to me.
It was the first night.
"And I was so afraid that the morning was going to open, and I was calling my wife, and I said, ""I can't know it."" And he said to me, ""No, if you're going to do it, I've come to you in the bar."
It's waiting, if you're going to stay and say.
Even though it's a big deal.
You're going to do all the things you need to do.
"And again, again, if you're afraid, and you're afraid, if your body doesn't listen to you, ""Yes, it's taken. I'm not looking at it!"
"You're certainly coming from my hand."" You're going to work until you're going to say."" And I did that."
"For five years, I've been reading the top pill of the Nobel Prize, and for a few years, I've been in Northwest, I've been in Harvard, I'm working there, and I don't think about it, but for a long time, I've thought, "I'm not my place.""
"And at the end of the first year I was at Harvard, I didn't speak at school for a year, and I came to my college, and I said, ""If you don't get involved or you're going to get rid of it,"" and I didn't know it well."
"He went into the inside in a completely depressed situation, and he said, ""Well, it's not my place."
This was the point of return for me.
Because two things did.
The first thing I realized was, I'm not going to pass that feeling anymore.
But he felt, and those feelings met me.
Secondly, I realized he was in the right place.
So he could look at it by imitating it.
"And I said to him, ""Look, it's all about us!"
"I said, ""He's going to show himself as if he's coming to me from the morning, he's going to show himself strong, and you're going to go into the school room and give you the best gift that he's given today."" And he did that. He didn't know that he was sitting here. (Laughter) A few months later he came to me, and I saw him imitating him, not until he felt true, but until he felt real."
It changed.
I wanted to tell you, too.
imitate it until it's real.
Just show yourself as much as you want to be.
I want you to know.
Cusial corrections can lead to such big changes.
Now, I said two minutes ago.
Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.
So, before you're going to do this for a second, try to do it for two minutes: in the room, in the room, on the table, on the door attached.
Take what you want to do.
Make your brain feel that the best thing is going to happen.
You increase your testosterone. You decrease your cortizol.
"""Oh, I didn't show them what I was capable."" Don't allow them to end with a search."
"You say, ""I'm going to reach them and show them what I am!""
I want you to share it with other people, because it's very honest.
It's not self-assembly. (Laughter) You share this lesson with people, because people who will be able to do it are not necessarily technology and resources, not status and trust.
And share it with them so that they can use it.
Because in isolation, two minutes of attention to their bodies can really affect their lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
We have a lot of refugees in the world.
And one of the things that's most invisible among their superorganisms is invisible.
They're the workers who collect materials that are re-implanted to live, in terms of catators.
Katators are doing a hard, honest and necessary job that's useful for all of them, but they're not grateful for it.
Here, in Brazil, 90 percent of the products that are re-implanted — what they collect.
A lot of the catalysts are working on the ground. They're running out of the smallpox, and they're going to go back to the empires.
Karrows are cars that are made out of a bag or methane, and they're reminded of gravity and a little story that happened in Brazil.
And that's why I didn't meet these superheroes.
I'm an activist, an activist, and I'm an activist, and I'm an activist, and I'm an activist, and I'm an activist, and I'm an activist, and I'm an activist, and I'm an activist, and I'm also an activist, and I'm an activist, and I'm an activist, and I'm an activist, and I'm an activist, and I'm an activist, and I'm an activist, and I'm interested in social, social, social, social, social, social and environmental.
In 2007, I turned my job from the divales to the corroses to the city's lives to the city.
But this time, I added the catalyst.
And I had a lot of attention to my work, and I had a lot of attention to my career, and it helped them bring these cathedrals into the center of attention and help them grow their trusts.
Today, they're famous in the public and social media in the smallest.
So I've always been working on this time since I met this world.
I've lost over 200 cars in many cities, and I've been invited to a lot of travelers and travelers around the world.
I came to the point that the catadors, with their invisibility, are not just in Brazil.
I found them in developing countries like Argentina, Chile, South Africa, Afghanistan, even Japan and the United States.
And then I realized that more people should be involved in this, because it was a big deal.
"So after that, I created an honor under the title of ""Pimp My Carroça."" (Laughter) It's an honor that's known to be paid by the public."
Thank you.
(Applause)
"It was a great honor of the community that was created with the help of the cathedrals and the charroaches, ""Look at my Karrocha.""
The catalyst was funded by colleagues, dentists, pediatricians, hairstyles, massage therapists, well-known professionals and health agencies like this.
Now, when the corroses were removed by our ancestors, they were given their parents to see the public villages and the beaches and the cities that didn't rain.
And they also took other tools to do it: the vertical lenses, the vertical lenses and the sensory lenses.
Eventually, they would be part of this great and great expedition by crying out by the little grandchildren.
"""Look at my Karrocha"" came out to São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and the little Kuribita."
"And we created a Pimpx, inspired by TEDx, inspired by the city outside of Brazil, which is a simplified version of ""Make my Karrocha,"" which is an enlightened, paid version by the city."
So he would all be able to put it together.
"In about two years, I had 170 katadors, 800 volunteers and 200 children, and more than 1,000 donors have been joined in the ""Audience of my Karrocha."" Their help was re-educated even in local schools."
And then when the cathedrals put invisible back, they would be people who were respectful and valuable.
They were able to deal with great ideas because of their eyesighted corrosions, and they were able to increase their income and their relationship with society.
Now, I'm going to invite you to find the cathedrals in your city and other invisible superheroes and recognize them.
Try to see the world as a whole without constraints and nodes.
You don't want to believe, there are more than 20 million cathedrals in the world.
When you see someone coming from it, you know them as part of the life of our society.
Oh, Orbigado, thank you.
(Applause)
On the 5th of November, in 1990, a man named Al-Saiid Nosair went to the hotel at Manhettend and joined the leader of the Jewish Jewish Church.
He was unheard before Nosair was buried, but when he took a visit on the surface of the streets, with other collaborators in New York, they set up attacks plan to go into the headquarters of the New York City: tunnels, buses and conferences.
The plans of happiness were underestimated by the FTB Council.
But it turns out, in 1993, the World Trade Organization didn't prevent bombsight.
At the end of Nosair, he was very excited about each other.
My father is Al-Saiid Nosair.
In 1983, in Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, I looked at the world as a child of his wonderful engineers and brilliant American, Buddhist school teachers, and they didn't let me go from my hands to live a happy child.
After I was seven years old, my family started to change the world.
My father forced me to see that Islam, a lot of Muslims, was a witness of very few people.
But from my experience of life, I've learned this: after people have known each other enough, it doesn't take a long time to understand that we're all the same in life as the future.
It's possible to come in every language, even if there's a few people in every nation who are willing to push themselves into the way they want to drive their own lives, who feel the dignity.
A few months ago, my father told me that he had been working with his friends for the last couple of weeks on the London Island to get to the police school.
And he said I'm going to go with him in the morning.
We arrived at the Calverton Space Station, and we didn't know that it was in the secret witness of F TB at the time.
The next time my father came up to me, he helped me keep my shirt in my flower, and he managed to figure out how to take care of 30 meters.
The last one that I've been wearing this day came up with a little light bulb on the surface of the snow, and then it came up with a light bulb, and it was all fascinated by it, and I'm particularly.
"And I went back to other people, and he said, ""Yes, Abuh."" He said, ""It's the fish of his father."
They all laughed at this word, but after a few years, I really understood what they were laughing.
They thought that my father was powerful, and they also saw the humility in me.
Finally, these people were very excited about the death of six people and the death of over 1,000 people and the death of more than 1,000 people in the World Trade Center.
These people are people who I've taken the bricks to myself.
"They were people I called ""Amy.""
As I was 19 years old, we changed our health place 20 times, and that change that took me all the time of my childhood caused my friends to be very few.
It would be one of the things that we would be able to get someone closer to myself and move to other places.
As a new person, I've always been converted into the audience of the kids that you're really learning.
I kept my identity secret from my college colleagues to not be at the center of justice, but it turns out that it was enough to be the most secret and the top of the new college.
So I spent a lot of my time reading books at home, watching books or playing games.
So I had conflicts in social communities, and I wasn't prepared for the rest of my life, as I was growing up in a great fanist family.
I grew up in a world where people were judged as religion and religion.
So what happened when I opened my eyes?
One of my first experiments that led me to this kind of thinking was the year 2000 Congress.
I've been willing to participate in the National School meeting in Philadelphia in the U.S. preparation department.
By the time I was in the audience, I was driven by violence between Congress, and I wasn't going to fight the violence of children who were dealing with a lot of their lives.
It was people who lived in different ways in our community.
I learned that one of the kids I met in the last days of the exhibition was Jewish.
This fact only happened for a few days, but as I wanted, I realized that there was no conflict between us.
I didn't have been a Jewish friend before, and I said that I felt angry because I knew the barries that believed that I was not allowed for all my life.
And one more important moment of transformation was the work that I found in the busch gardens on the Square for extra gains.
I've been here with people from different religions and societies, and it has played a great role in the evolution of my experience.
I've learned that a big part of my life is a crime of compassion, and at the end of the day, all the gees have a sense of meaning.
And it turns out that I was able to work with geologists in one of the shows, and at the same time, many of them were the most prosperous and most prosperous people I've ever seen to land.
I've learned that, as a child, I've been very studied in the childhood, I feel like I'm going to burn other people's lives, and it's an honor to make a talk that I don't want to face to others.
As I felt, I was trying to combine the lessons that I learned from childhood with the experience of life.
I don't know what it sounds like to be like, but I've met a lot better with what screaming is because of reasons that don't depend on you.
"And then there was ""The Daily Show."" Con Stüart encouraged me to be honest with myself about my fanism, and he helped me tell me that man's moral, religious and gender orientation wasn't relevant to his moral agenda."
Con Stüart, at the moment that my dad needed, was really obsessed with me in the sense of the word.
The inspiration comes from a place where it's not so long ago, and the fact that the Jewish comedian has more impacted my worldview than my Catholic father.
And one day, I was fascinated with me about the change of my worldview, and he told me a promise that I couldn't get out of my whole life.
"My mother looked at me with the eyes of the tiredness, as a man who lived enough dopamine throughout his life, and she said, ""I was tired of hating people."
I understood how much sense of energy it was required for the feeling of hatred within a moment.
My grandfather is not my real step.
I changed my name when I decided to start my relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I get myself to the challenge that I'm going to have?
It's very honest.
And I hope that maybe any time someone who's exposed to violence will hear my story and have the difference that there's a better way, and I'm not a fanatic, even though I'm not going to go to a non-tolerant ideology.
In fact, I chose to use my life experience as a service for terrorism and fanism.
I'm calling it for terrorists and their victims, the terrible suffering and the violence that terrorism has lived to them.
I'm going to take care of my father's actions that I'm not going to be able to take care of terrorists like this.
As a true example of my audience, I am a living wish that violence is not supposed to go through religion and religion, and that son is not supposed to go through his father's path.
I'm not like my father.
Thank you very much. (Applause) I'm going to thank you all. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) I'm going to talk. (Applause)
Good morning!
Are we?
They took a step-by-step line on them, but I wanted to ask you, who's here writing his name on his wife in Arabic?
Anybody wrote? Who? Well, there's no problem.
A while ago, one day, I sat with my friend in the restaurant and offered food.
"I looked at the office and I said, "Do you have a mother? (Applause)"
He was surprised to see me thinking he was hearing the word wrong.
"He said, ""Come on? (In English)" And I said, ""Meny, no humility."" And he said, ""What do they say to him we don't know?"" "I know.""
"He said, ""No! It's called ""In English,"" or ""In English."" Is my French language right?"
"He said, ""Well, come to work with this!"" The director said."
"He was angry to talk to me, and he said to himself, "If he was the most angry girl in this world, I wouldn't look at him!""
"What does it mean not saying ""Menu"" in Arabic?"
The young boy in Liban, in two words, was left behind and judged as ignorant.
How could he talk like this?
Now, I started thinking.
And that made me wonder.
That's really the trick of the man.
They don't accept me because I speak in my own language.
Is this going to happen on another map?
How did we fall?
But as we're here, there's a lot of people here like me who come to a point in their own lives that they're taking hands as extraordinary than everything they're doing in the past to know they're just modern and legal.
Should I forget all my politics, all my ideas, all my strength, all my passion?
Children's interests about education might be our best interests.
I've learned in Arabic just to adapt everything.
Should I forget to be one of them?
Is it hard for me here?
Despite all of this, I was trying to deal with it.
I didn't want to justify him by the surprise that he made me justice.
English doesn't respond to the day.
It's not the language of research, it's not the language of research, it's not the language that we're willing to provide a broad research study where we're used in our universities, and it's not the language that we use in our airports.
If we were to do that, they would be our shoes.
Why don't I use my language in the water? We can't all give it water!
We want us to use Arabic. Where should we use it?
This is a reality.
But there's another more important reality we need to think about.
Language is the main language.
In translation, you have to be perfect in your main language to be perfect in other languages.
It's important in the main language to be able to express their ideas in creative ways in perfect other languages.
What?
He used Arabic when he started writing for the first time he started writing the Koran.
His whole idea, his imagination and his grandchildren, who had a special object, had a special voice heard of his grandchildren in the village.
So when he started writing in that English language, he had enough base.
And so when he's reading his writing in English, you're feeling that box, you're passing those senses.
You can imagine that Adam, who's written in English, is the son from the mountains of Lebanon.
It's a myth that nobody can argue.
Secondly, it's also said, if you want to kill a nation, the only way you don't kill a nation is to kill her language.
This is a reality that developed societies know.
The Germans, the Germans, the Germans, the crops, the Cheeks — these nations are different from this dream.
So they're allowed to protect their own language.
They're making it clear.
So they use language in terms of language, and they use a lot of paper to develop language.
Do we know more than that?
Well, not from the developed world, it's not the idea that it's not going to come to us yet, and we wanted to stand up with the public world.
Once we were like us, but there was research for development, and when the U.K., the U.K., the U.K., the U.K., the U.K., the U.K., and so on, they put their languages with themselves, and they kept them not taking it.
They kept language close to themselves.
Because if you take a product from the country or from another country, and there's no label on it in English, it's not a local product.
You didn't believe it was a local product.
They'd be receivers as they used to be. They'd be desirable receivers as we've been in many times.
So in order to innovate and innovate, they had to protect their own language.
"But I say, ""The injustice, the injustice, the injustice."" (Laughter) What will this remind you?"
How many of you can't remember, right?
Who, how and why it is.
Language isn't just the way words come out of our mouth, it's not the way it works.
Language illustrates certain stages in our lives and terminology that depends on our origins.
"So, when we say, "" injustice, justice, injustice,"" each of you has special images in your mind, special public affairs, special senses for a particular day."
It's not a language, it's not a word, it's two or three words, it's not a combination.
It's an idea of how we think, how we see each other, how others see us.
What is innovation?
What can you say, this man is dealing with, right?
"So, if I say, ""The injustice, the injustice, the injustice,"" or if your son comes to say, "Oh, do you live in the English?""
What do you feel?
If you don't see the problem, it's okay, I'm going to go out and not talk to the empty place.
The idea is that these expressions remind us something special.
I have a Brazilian friend who's married with my wife.
I asked him one day, how do things work?
"He said, ""It's all good. But I've tried one day to translate the word ""toborni"" for him all night."" (Laughter) (Applause) The woman wrote to her wrongly call her ""toborni,"" and then she tried to explain the word all night."
"He said, ""How can man be so crazy?""
He wants to suicide?
""It's me? (In English)" This is one of a few missiles."
We started to think that because she can't deal with her, she can't tell her that word, and she's willing to deal with her. She's a way of thinking.
"And he said to me, ""He's going to listen to the Pharaoh, and one night I was trying to convince him that he would feel what I felt when I was listening to the Fair."" And the writer woman tried to translate it to him, "I extended my hands from them and I grew up with you."" (Laughter) And that's the problem: "And because you're born to them, I took my hands back and left you." (Laughter)"
Think about it for me.
(Applause) What did we do to protect Arabic?
We turned it into the case of the civil society, and we started to college to protect the Arabic language.
"After all, a lot of people told me, ""What do you care about?"
"Don't forget that concept and do it for yourself."" There's no problem!"
"And this was the honor of the law to protect his language: "I'm talking to you about religion, and you're responding to me from the Bible.""
"We didn't say, ""No, we don't accept it or accept it."" We didn't choose that way, because they didn't deal with us in this way."
And if anybody talks to me in that way, I hate Arabic.
We say, (Applause) We want to change our own reality in a way that illustrates our dreams, our desires and our daily lives.
We're going to be happy with the way the sky looks like us and think like us.
"So, ""I talk to you about college, but if you respond to me from college,"" it was a sad thing."
Very honest, at the same time, creative and credible.
And then we started with another paper that was written in the bag.
"You can't see this example at the moment, and on the top of the white and yellow lens, it's written, ""Don't kill your song!""
Why? In fact, don't kill the language.
We shouldn't kill our language from birth.
If we had to kill our language, we had to find who we were.
We had to find our potential.
We had to go back at the beginning.
It's also a serious thing about losing our chance to be modern and public.
After that, we've spread images of all the Arab men and girls who have been abused.
"""Cool"" pictures of girls and boys."
We were very cool.
"And somebody says, ""Oh, you speak English!"" I say, ""Yeah, I've understood the word ""colum."" Now, if you don't forgive me, they want to do it, but give me a better promise, let me express reality better."
"I'm going to continue to say "" internet."" I'm going to say, ""I'm going to the world's puzzle tower."" (Laughter) Because it's not bad! We shouldn't cheat ourselves."
But as it comes to this point, we have to believe that if you're told something, we shouldn't allow people to believe that we're bigger or we think we're a population in our face that you're going to control us and think and feel what they want to us.
It's an idea to be creative.
If we don't know how to fly on a plane, or we don't know how to fly on a plane, and so we can be creative.
Now, you're all creative.
Creativity in your main language is a way.
Let's start here.
Let's take a novel, or take a short film.
Once, the novel can make us globalized again.
This Arabic language can come back to becoming a humanism.
"It's not easy to say, ""There's no way to go."" There's a way to go."
But we have to know, and we have to believe that there's a way to find out, and it's our debt to be part of that journey.
Well, what can you do today?
Tvites, who's screaming?
Even if my time is established, I'd like you to please whether it's Arabic, English, French or Chinese.
But don't write in Arabic with the graph of Latin that's covered with numbers.
(Applause) That's the trick! That's not the language!
You enter the virtual world with virtual language.
It's not easy to fly back from such a place.
This is the first thing we can do.
Secondly, there are many other things that we can do.
We're not here today to believe each other.
We're here that this language has reached the importance of protecting it.
Now I'm going to give you a sir.
It's the first time that the body knows his mother through language.
"When my daughter was born, I'm going to tell her, ""This is your father, I'm sorry. (Laughter)" I'm not going to say to her in English, ""This is your dad, honey."" And my daughter Nura says, in the supermarket, she says to me in Arabic, ""Be so good."" And I say to her, ""Merci, Mom,"" she says, ""I'm going to go and I'm not going to hope that nobody heard her."
(Applause) Well, let's take ourselves from adapting this policy. (Applause)
I learned a few things when I was doing these 30-day trials.
For the study, I took a picture every day within a month.
I'm 30 days before I started trials.
It's very bad.
In fact, they should be very young.
(Applause)
Since I read a good school, I had a high school, and I began to live a life full of love, passion and passion and passion.
And in fact, I was afraid of the gap that I felt very uncomfortable, very insecure, from the people who were taught, from the future to the future, and from the gap that I felt in.
"As everybody started, as I did before, I heard an amazing voice, ""Oh, he's leaving the room."" I was painting at the edges."
There was no one on my side, and the light and precision of the universe that I knew was absolutely perfect.
"""He opens his door."" I heard."
This was the beginning. This was the beginning.
And before days, after weeks, I did everything, he told me about the third person.
""He's going to go to the museum.""
So he called his friend and his hopeful friend, and even a while later, and I thought, well, that's what I'm not going to exaggerate at the time.
For my mission, when I was secreting my authenticity and my real feelings, the voice came.
And what happened with this was that the ordinary people didn't hear the sounds, and I didn't hear it in a serious position.
It's the feeling that I've taken to my colleague.
I needed this kind of interest, and I started talking to him about my grandfather.
"In fact, I was working on the student's television as a reporter of college news, and I was going to go to the museum in the middle of the night and say, ""Okay, I'm not going to come."
And then the situation began to get out of my office very quickly.
I was in trouble, and then I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, and then the most important thing: an astonishing sense of humility, of humility and of humility associated with me and my future.
It wasn't the experience of life that I was like, but because I was convinced that it was a crime, it started to encourage my fear and my passion.
It was a kind of psychic trial against this anxiety, and it started to increase the number of calls and to be more hostile and more hostile.
Can you see the stake in the water?
In fact, there was a period of fear, deception, indifference and uncertainty, and I wasn't talking about the idea of creating peace and peace in this process that I felt uncomfortable.
Two years later, my life started to collapse.
But I've got all the blessings of the girl: the great sounds, the great images, the wonder, the unconscious numbers.
Now, when I look at the mountain of those years and the unheard, I think a man died, and a man died.
A person who was confined and quietly frustrated was sent to the water, and he looked at the right out of that meeting, and he looked at the return to a person I had to be raised by the end.
A lot of people have lost me all over my life, and they're all reminded of me, but they're very weak and vulnerable to the people who helped me.
I believe Eleanor's going to do that.
"And if it rains in the middle of the moon, then it's really spreading."" And in 14 minutes, it doesn't bother me and me to thank these beautiful people that wait for me to come back from the grass and the grass and the grass and the grass."
And of course, it was hard to believe in this because it came to the enemy, and it was hard to believe in it before, because the first important thing was that I didn't learn to admit that I was telling the truth that I was telling before.
For my mission, I've learned to explain the calls that I'm going to attack my house — not as a real, but as a sense of fear and comfort that I feel.
I often believed in them.
I remember one night I was sitting in the door of my grandparents, and I was photographing their cousins to protect them from what I really thought was true.
"You know, ""Don't work with me."
"Do I have plastic sticks you don't see?"" That's my strategy."
And after I complained about this, unfortunately, I've taken myself out of pieces now and now, and I've gone back to psychology in a completely different role, by stepping out of strings.
Now, I'm very proud of being a professor Romme and Dr. Sandy Escher's work, who's going out of the work of the University of İntervoice, who's taking calls as a life strategy, an approach to language with voice, ignorance, not as a schizophrenia principle, comes from a difficult, important and meaningful thing to learn.
What this kind of society is possible, even being established.
There's a quote from Chávez that if there's a social change, there's no return.
It's not going to kill the people.
But it's not going to inspire people who don't fear.
In the last 20 years, we've been a missionary and a missionary in five and 26 countries, and by working together, we've expanded the opportunities of people with fear, dignity and humility, and we've become hopeful leaders and CEOs, and we've been working on the human work of our science.
As Peter Levin said, it's a great creature that has a spiritual dress to use this gift that has access to human assistance.
From that point of view, the greatest blessing for our public service is to help, to be alongside, to expand, to share and to give up his suffering.
We're unique. We don't get it wrong.
It's never going to take or steal what's happening in our lives.
It doesn't look like it.
"As a great guy once said to me, ""Don't tell you what other people say in your house."
"Talk about you."" Thank you very much."
(Applause)
I'm here to talk about my literature.
But is this photographic?
Because, of course, it's not a picture you can take with your camera.
Again, my photographer started when I got my first photo at 15.
I've been playing this with my previous masterpiece, but in a slightly different way, because when I use the camera, I've designed the process before a plant.
When you take a photo with a photojournalist, it's ready to print a piece of paper.
So for me, photography wasn't just about being in the right place at the right time.
I thought everybody could do that.
So I wanted to create something different, something that started to happen after the images were taken.
And these are pictures like this: this is the document that works on a road.
But it was surrounded by an unprecedented game.
And despite that, it looks really close.
Or pictures like this — both dark and colored, but they all lead to a certain degree of realization.
When I say that, I'm going to take a photo-realism.
Because, of course, these are not really pictures that we're going to paint, but I wanted to have visible images that could be taken with a camera.
I wanted you to have a little bit of images that you would think about to deal with.
So it's really about keeping a better idea than keeping a moment.
Is it in the middle of the way that makes it look real?
Does it relate to these details or colors?
Does it relate to beauty?
What about creating illusion?
It's often about creating illusion.
But then, how did it deal with the world, two-dimensional, two-dimensional, two-dimensional, is how to do it.
It's not really what this reality is, it's really what reality looks like to us.
So it's a very real idea.
I see this when I put real works somewhere, creating a real inventor that I created a virtual reality.
Let me show you a real example.
There's a three-dimensional physical object that's perfectly imagined, and it's a three-dimensional object that's related to our world.
But when it comes together in a certain way, it looks like a three-dimensional structure that is still there.
We also know that it doesn't exist.
So we're playing with our brains, because our brains can't accept that reality is not meaning.
And I also see the same process when you put pictures together.
It's actually about combining different facts.
So a picture of real things, things that we don't think about myself, things that are all around us in our everyday lives.
It's really important to get this out of the box when you put it together, because most of all, it seems wrong in a way.
What I'd like to say is that there are three things that we have to do to get a real case.
As you can see, there's no special side of these pictures.
But when it's integrated, it takes something like this.
So in the first way, the images that are connected should be the same.
Secondly, the same should be the light of the images that are connected.
And in these two ways, these two things were taken from the same height and the same light.
And the third is that it's impossible to make a picture budget, make a picture end on the map, separate the other from the map.
It has to be integrated in a way that can't be distinguished from how it's created.
By adapting the landscape, the landscape, the brightness, the depth of the landscape, the color left and the brightness of the landscape, we remove the intersection between different images, and we allow it to look like a single description, although it's kind of a hundred of like this.
This is another example.
(Laughter) People can think that this is a place where it's a place, and it's the bottom of the changed place.
But in fact, it's a whole picture that happens when different places are assembling pictures.
I mean, creating a place is easier than finding a place, and you don't have to change your ideas in this way.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And I knew that I had a few months since this idea came to my network, and I had a few months to find different places for planning and reconstructing the parts of the inventor.
For example, the fish was taken by holding a fish.
And the beaches are different landscapes.
Six layers of water were taken in a stone bar.
And yes, I even painted the house on the island in red to look more Swedish.
So it's possible to get something close to reality, in terms of planning.
It always starts with an idea, an idea.
And then we're going to bring together different pictures.
In this way, each piece has a very good plan.
And if you take pictures well, the case is so beautiful and it can also be very realistic.
So we have all the benefits that we need, and the only thing that push us is our imagination.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Julian, thank you.
It was given that WikiLeaks published more data than the data that the whole world magazine published in the last year.
Is that possible?
Julian Assange: Well, is this possible to be true?
Isn't it that the rest of the world's media is so bad to work? A small group of activists are able to spread more information than all the world's media.
CA: How do you do that?
How do people spread these documents?
How is the definition of privacy?
JA: As far as we know, these are the ones that are breaking data, and there are different ways to get this data to us.
We're encrypting the data to prevent surveillance, to easily spread online, and we're invited to public institutions like Sweden and Belgium to provide the law enforcement.
It's encrypted, or it's encrypted, and it's analyzed, formated, as it's in news agencies — it can be a little bit difficult when there's a big database — and it's going to explain to the document and protect ourselves against possible and political attacks.
CA: So it means that the data is provided, and you don't know who the data is for a lot of time.
JA: It's true. We rarely know them. If we find the source of information, we immediately destroy that information.
(Applause) Zabbel.
(Laughter) CA: I was the CIA, asking TED the code of being released. (Laughter)
I mean, let's not look at the monarchy myths.
This is data that was broken a few years ago.
Let's not look at you.
It was a story from Kenya.
How do you talk about how you don't break this story?
JA: This is the Royal Report.
It was a survey published by the Kenyan government after the 2004 Congress.
By 2004, Kenya had been governed by Daniel 8, 18 years ago.
In Kenya, my refugee was a dictator.
And when they went to the Gabby Council with the power of the coalition and started negotiating with corruption, they published this conference with two million pounds of money.
They also used this campaign as a political force against Moya, who was the most existential man in Kenya at the time and then.
Who's the great book of Kenya's literature?
I was going to Kenya a little bit before the 28th election in 2007, and I could get the documents.
We published this article three days later when the new president Kibabi Daniel Moin started approaching the man who was going to put his hand on the press, and after this event, the president of Kibabi was in the prison.
CA: It's short of a long term — it's not just Kenya's office, it's been sent to the entire city through roads, and if you think, it's changed the outcome of these meetings.
JA: Yeah. In the headquarters of the Guardian, then in countries around Kenya, Tanzania and Canada were published in Africa.
The news came out.
And within a few days, the Kenyan press began to be comfortable writing about it.
Twenty days later, it was published in the Kenya Journal, and according to the Kenyan Department of Health, it changed 10 comments, and it led to the change of the results.
CA: So the data that you've broken really changed the world?
JA: Yeah.
(Applause) CA: Now, this time, there's a video about the air cell in India.
The video itself is a little bit long. It's a short clip.
First of all, there's a little bit of violence in this video.
Radio: Well, it's cool, if you just open them up.
Now they're looking, they're looking at X-ray.
It's the moon. It's the sun.
If you see everybody, it's the news. Thank you.
Shoot it all.
The sun, the sun!
(Audience from automatic weapons) Don't take it, keep it. (Audience from automatic weapons) Yeah.
The hotel — Bushmaster Two-Six, Bushmaster Two-Six.
I had to go back, down.
We killed all eight people.
There are two megolytes, and we're going to continue to work.
It was. They all died.
Two-Six, two-Six, is in action.
Oops. With connection. What was that?
Zabbel, Saul. Oh, it's solved, it's solved.
CA: So how did this picture look like?
JA: It was heavy for people who were in this work.
Two people were sent to the Bağway to study this video.
This is actually one of three attacks in the video.
CA: If I don't do that, there are 11 people who died in this attack because of the two headlines of Reuters?
JA: Yeah. Two reporters died, two children were injured.
At the end of the year, 18,000 men died.
CA: The publication of this has led to a huge spread.
What did you think was the main cause of this humiliation and humiliation?
JA: I don't know exactly, I mean, people have seen the extraordinary state of power.
People who are comfortable with babies are flying with 30 millimeters of astrolytes flying over the airplane — and without any reason — and they're killing even those who are killed by the wounded.
There were two students who were accurate who weren't a student, and they saw their own work.
CA: The U.S. Department of State, Bradley Manning, was frustrated, and he said, in his interview room, he admitted that 280,000 U.S. citizens were writing to you.
Is that true?
JA: We refused to get these books.
Five days ago, after we cut 50 out of 150,000 writing that he had, he was arrested.
This year ago, we published public papers in the U.S. State Department in Hawaii, but they don't have to do that.
I was in that prison.
CA: If you were to get the U.S. government diplomacy papers?
JA: We published them. (CA: Did we do this.) JA: Yeah. CA: Why? JA: And so, what's happening in the world's truth in these papers, is that people's opinion in the U.S., in the U.S. countries, shows the status of human rights.
If you don't open the secret documents, there's this kind of data.
CA: Well, we're talking about it a little bit about it.
What kind of ideology do you rely on?
So what do you think about the publication of secret documents?
JA: There's a question like, which science is important for the world, which science can lead to reintegration.
In fact, there's a lot of information.
It's a sense that the news that they're using to hide the public power is going to be something new and good, and the institutions that have this information know how to hide the data themselves.
It's always going to happen in the audience, and it's also going to depend on the history of the public.
CA: But it's not a little dangerous, it can be a bad result for people, even for the whole society, because it doesn't depend on you when it's broken.
JA: That's not the case in the data that we spread.
So we have a policy to get rid of harm.
There are other public reports that we're going to publish after we communicate with the person itself.
There's also blood vessels — in fact, the patient's parents, the patient's nurses, they're treated with the law, but we're working with the news providers who really know what they're doing.
CA: I mean, they all know their work well.
"But a guy who's sitting in the U.S. office approached you, and said, ""You know, you're publishing to you what someone wants to spread with a purpose?"" This is the video."
The American officer shows that people laugh when they die.
It shows millions of people in the world that the American army doesn't have human senses. It's not true.
"My son isn't like this. What are you going to do with this?"" What are you going to answer?"
JA: That's actually a lot of work.
But remember, people in India, Iraq, East don't need to see this video; they see it every day.
It's not changing their ideas; it's not changing their senses, their senses.
That's what they see every day.
It's going to change the value of the people who are paying attention to this debate, but that's what we're doing.
CA: So you don't find a way to illuminate the secrets of government and companies.
It's good to celebrate.
But what's amazing is that in order to light your eyes, you have to keep your own secrets hidden.
JA: It's not exactly that. There's no one who's going to face WikiLeaks.
Or we don't have any data that's more than anything else.
If there are books and lots of them, it might be difficult for us, and we work so that people who work with us are trying to help us do our work if they don't waste us, if they don't waste us.
CA: It's interesting to me, as I heard in India — what do TEDsters think about this?
There are two ideas about WikiLeaks and Julian.
One — it's an amazing thing that makes my relationship clear.
It's going to be a big deal.
Who thinks it's crazy?
What is it that's going to be dangerous?
JA: Well, there must be a few men without a few.
CA: These were my refugees, Julian.
We need to work a little bit more. Let's show you another example.
This time it's not published yet, but it's going to be published at TED.
That's an interesting fact that we're doing in the nearest place, right?
What is this story?
JA: This is an example of what we're seeing every day.
Last year — in New York — there's been a lot of diving in Albania, like the Gulf of Mexico, even though it's not as powerful as the blindness.
We've got an engineering survey that actually works with the way the shipping cars that the farmers put on the board of the party companies.
And there was a lot of people in the library and other people here.
But it didn't have anything to do with them. It was a little bit difficult.
We didn't know exactly who wrote and what it was about.
And we thought, well, there might be a game for the king's business.
"So we looked at the papers, and we wrote the answer, ""We're a little bit skeptical."
We don't know what we're going to do.
"It's yours. It looks right, but we don't know what's going on."" Once a week ago, we were trying to find the database of the data, and we got the answer from the office that wrote this article — (Laughter) — and it was written, ""We want to find the code of the data."" And we said, ""Let's give you a little bit of information."
What kind of paper do you talk about?
Is it true to you as your rule?
"Are you really real?"" They responded to the email of the owner of the text on the screen with Microsoft Word ID."
That's how it was.
(Applause) That's actually a lot of happening.
One of the ways to determine the structure of the paper is one of the methods that makes it difficult to write a book.
CA: Do you have BP-based reports?
JA: Yeah, so many, but we're currently working on funding for the conference, and the engineers are coming out of their hands.
We've reduced the information that we've been documenting because we've been trying to rebuild the core of the magazine for the last few months to protect our public interests.
That's a little problem.
So, as institutions that start in new operations, we're also struggling to get up from one another, and we don't have enough employees to get all of this data out of it, even though we've already got a lot of data.
CA: So what you need is it going to go to the primary school students and/and-a-sex students to get a job?
JA: Yeah. People we're also going to believe.
It's also hard to develop one in order to get a little bit different in the world, and we need people who are high-level, and we need people who are now able to deal with the health care.
CA: So can you tell you why we started this work?
I don't read the hard story that you didn't change 37 schools when you were a kid.
Is this data true?
JA: My parents were at the film office, and I didn't go out of religious papers, and it was the result of both of them.
(Laughter) CA: The psychologists would accept this as a paranoid concept.
JA: Are you going to show you the film business?
(Laughter) (Applause) CA: I knew that you would have a problem in young years of age as well as aaker, as a journalist.
JA: I was just a feminist.
I was one of the young students who was a journalist.
I was incarcerated by the fact that I was interviewed at the age of nine.
You've got to act a little bit more with the hackers.
It's possible to do different things with the way that it works.
The fact is that most Indian hackers are engaged in getting a doll on the bank account of your grandmother for Russian media.
The Xerox sales didn't look like before.
CA: Now, I don't think that you're going to be trying to kill someone's money. What are the good values?
Can you give them brief information, or can you talk about the cause of creating them, or about events?
JA: I don't think it's going to happen.
But my main values are: I mean, the rich and the rich people don't create things; they help the poor.
And that's what I learned from people in my life, like my father.
CA: It doesn't create human prosperity; does it protect them?
JA: I'm a little prosecutor, and I don't really protect them, I don't show them the blindness, but in the middle of the way — I'm going to protect people out of trial, and I'm going to protect people out of trial.
And that's what I've been doing for a long time.
CA: Can you talk briefly about what happened in the last few minutes?
And because of the fact that you published there, the bank had a problem, and the news agency that had the data was also presented.
And in fact, the news was getting broken.
You've created a good image for the future. What happened then?
JA: That was a big deal.
It was the case for the future.
It was one of the biggest things in the world.
It's been 10 times more than any other market in the bank office.
We published this data last year.
"In fact, five of them were released in the television, and they were given to the audience before, like in the movies, five of the news about the public office, and they started before and they didn't know what the camera would do, "Well, it never happened. What would we do?""
We published the news in the morning, in the morning, and we were very excited about it, even talking about what was going on.
Everybody believed in the universe that this would not happen again, and in fact, after we met some of the Iranian ministers and some of the senior experts, there was a new law that was given to the Icelandic minister of Justice, which is one of the most fundamental laws in the world to protect journalists, which is based on the Nobel Prize Prize for his resignation.
Iceland had been involved in the system of other Scandinavian countries, compared to Norway.
And just a month ago, this law was secretly adopted in the Islamic Parliament.
CA: Okay.
(Applause) So let's take a lot of water, Julian.
How do you believe that it's going to be going to happen? It's going to be going to control everything in a secret way, or would people like to control the Great Wall, or would it be something else?
JA: I'm not quite sure what's going to happen.
All over the world — from the U.S., from China to the U.S., there's an increase in speech freedom and freedom of justice.
It's hard to see what's going to happen.
The time that we live is really interesting. We can change everything in a very cool way.
CA: Well, I feel what our listeners want to say, Julian, be brave, be empowered with you.
JA: Thank you very much, Chris. (CA: Thank you.) (Applause)
I'm a writer.
It's my job to tell the story and write the novel, and I want to talk to you a little bit about the art of writing the story today, and I'm going to talk a little bit about what's called the crime.
But before you start with this, let me tell you a little bit about your own personal story.
I'm going to use words, and I'm going to use words, and you're going to find a few things when you listen to my voice.
I was born in Cambridge, in France, in a family of Muslims.
After that incident, my friends are separated, and I've come to a match with me.
Since then, I grew up as a single child in the world of a single mother.
In the 1970s, the situation in Antarctica was a little weird.
Many of the families in our neighborhood were large families of father's family, and I grew up with my mother, the only divorced woman in the patriarchal world.
In fact, I grew up with women in two countries.
On the one hand, she was a young, global, modern, European Turkish woman — my mom.
On the other hand, I've always been a religious, less savanna, less racional name.
And she looked at the wall with the coral of the coral, and she looked at the coral of the coral, and she looked at the coral in a variety of ways in order to give the eyes of the evil.
The people who were in their hands, the people who were in their hands, went to visit the woman.
Every time, my mother had a little bit of yellow tecton in Arabic, as much as the number of yellow tectoners left to get red in his hand.
And then one of the dots was going to get into the hallway.
A week later, they went to the clinic of the patient.
I know that it might be so amazing to talk about these things in the face of my mind and the people who are conscious, but I didn't see that none of the people who came back to my wife had come back or had never been able to do it.
I asked me, how did I do it? That was the power of the prayer?
"He said, ""Well, God has the good, but it's the power of the fundamental things."" In my lessons, there's a lot of important lesson from him, if you want to have nothing in life, whether you want to be humiliated, whether it's the soul or the human spirit, you need to turn it into the valves of standing."
It's going to be built inside.
We're all in the public and public institutions.
We're all in it.
We're all born to a certain family, to a family, to a child, to a child.
But when we don't have any contact with the world outside of the world that we have today, we're faced with the risk of getting inside and outside.
We can reduce our capacity. We can break down. We know that when we stay in the world that we're living for a long time, we can break our sense of humanity.
If our friends, our friends, our colleagues, our business partners, our family are in, and if we're reading too much, it means that we're in most of us.
Women like my grandmother do something like this, and they cover the power with a bunch of pieces, or they turn the face of the power to the dives.
It comes out of the belief that exists, and it's not easy for a person to look at his own image for a long time.
And even though it's true, it's one of the greatest benefits of our world to live in the icons that share the ideas we read.
And it works everywhere, between liberals and monarchs, the monarchs and the monarchs, the monarchs and the monarchs, the monarchs, the monarchs and the monarchs.
We're building groups based on fluctuations and similarities, and we're making predictions about others.
As I think, the art of writing can be a key way to the transition of these institutional sculptures.
Even if the stories don't know how to distribute the land, there may be a lot of gravity in the middle of my life.
And by looking at these equations, we can even love what we see in other worlds.
When I was eight, I started writing stories.
One day, my mother gave me a little bit of color, and she told me that I would have a good idea to write my own stories.
Now I think it was a little bit scared by thinking at that time.
It was good to share my stories with my family at home, but it wasn't so good to talk to my family friends.
I was a introvert kid who was going to talk to me about the beautiful dancers, and I was going to be an introverted kid, so my mom thought that I was a good idea to write my daily narratives.
But he didn't know that I thought my life was really boring, and what I wanted to do was write about this uninteresting life.
Instead, I started writing about myself, not about myself, but about things that weren't about others.
That's how I started writing that would turn into my lifelong love.
For me, writing was the lives of others, the stories of others than the autobiographical manifest.
Let me give you a little bit of patience, and I don't tell you about these events that happened in my life.
And there's another thing that's been done in the process of this.
My mother became a diplomat.
And at the same time, I went out of this small, ambitious, middle-class environment, and I fell into a high school community in London, and I was the only student in college.
"For the first time, I came to a difficult world where I described it as ""the typical world."" There were children from all nations, but it didn't have a mission for the Catholic Church, not the Catholic Church, nor the school."
In fact, in this museum, children were accepted as having made their own personalities, not their own, but their own grandchildren.
We looked like the United Nations, and it was also kind of humiliating, except having a bad event in the name of the city, or having a breakdown of religion.
So the child was surrounded by a child's caregiver, and it was always paralyzed.
And I remember, when I was in this school, I was in the morning, and I was invited to kill the Afghan armed Papan, and he collected zero pounds in the music community.
(Laughter) At the same time, I've been running out of school and building a dream about being a seaist.
And for the first time, I saw the idea of public education in this school.
"And all the kids were asking me about ""Midnight Express."" They asked me how many letters I took every day, and they took all the species, and they asked me how long I started to cover my head."
I've learned three strereotypes associated with the West here, and these are: education, sculpture and mastery.
After Spain, we went back to Jordan, to Turkey and back to Antarctica.
I thought I was a living box that I'd be able to bring my imagination and my vital power to myself, all of these meetings.
The stories gave me the sense of coherence, continuity and interdependence — I was in real life without these senses.
When I was 20 years old, I went to the city of Pakistan, which I loved so much.
I lived in a very cosmopolitical and vivid environment, and I wrote one of my novels here.
I was there when I was sick in August 1999.
On the 3th of the morning, I saw I was coming out of a beautiful building, and he set me up.
Hisly, he had an old salesman, he didn't sell alcohol in his store, he didn't talk to other men and marjinal lives.
He was sitting in front of a long-term pair, a cross-section that was spreading through his eyes.
And I also saw that he gave him a gift from the crab that he took out of the crabs with his sharp eyes, and that's what I've been thinking about this night — the crab of the transgender that was crying with the translator on the side of the street.
When we're confronted with death and climbs, our global differences are going to fall, even though it's going to be a few hours, we're all one.
But I've always believed that storytelling has the effect of reading.
I don't want to say that biology is as powerful as a failure, but when we read a good novel, we're going to get away from our fish' comfort room, and we're starting to recognize people that we're never encountered in the dark of the night, and sometimes we're not good at the idea of it.
After that incident, I went to school girls in Boston and then in Michigan.
It wasn't just geographic, it was a complete change in my language view this time.
I started writing English.
Now, I can't do anything in English, and they ask me why I don't write in English, and it helps me change my language.
I love writing in English, I love writing in English, I love writing in poetic and literary, and I love writing in English, and I think it's more mathematical and literal.
I think I'm connected differently to each language.
As millions of people around the world, I've learned English later, English is a language that's later acquired.
And when you learn the language later, you're also willing to push what you've learned.
As language comes later, we want to talk more, do better words, do better words, talk less, because there's a big difference between our brains and our languages.
That difference is frightening.
But if we learn not to fear it, it can stimulate us.
And that was what I learned in Boston — it was the mountain that I lived, and it was a flash stimulus.
Now, when I've been following all my actions, I've been able to marry my daily prayer, and I can stay in one place after I've been married, but after I've been married.
I created a life for God's love of nature.
(Laughter) But instead of deciding somewhere, I went to Arizona.
And because my colleague was in Pakistan, I started walking between Arizona and Washington, and I couldn't feel so fast at the other two points of the world.
I'm a part of me, if you always say it's a place, from physical and spiritual.
It's like my stories are always with me to keep all my interests and parts out of me.
And I'm also thinking about him that when the story is more true than the story, it's going to kill his own story.
I'd like to share with you an idea about this.
One of the books that I wrote in English, in America, when he saw the light bulb, one of the people in the U.S. did this kind of thing.
"He said, ""I love the book."" He said, "But you were writing a little bit differently.""
(Laughter) I asked what he wanted to say.
"He said, ""Well, let's look at you, there are many Spanish, American, American students, but there's only Turkey, and he's a person."" And he's actually coming up at the University camp in Boston, because it's normal for me that there are more people than Turkey, but I'm going to understand what the teacher wants to say."
But I know her, I'm always going to keep doing it.
He wanted to be my own manifesto.
She wanted her to be a woman in the book because I was a woman.
Now, we're talking about changing the world of storytelling, but we can also see that politics has impacted the spread, the reading and the conflict.
A lot of the writers, and a lot of the people who don't speak from the West, have this experience.
If you're a woman from the Islamic world like me, they're waiting for you to write about the Islamic woman, it's better not to be happy.
They're waiting for you to write more accurate, sad, kind of typical stories, to get away from the polarity.
When I was a kid, I was in London, and the problems that I was worried about were also in the Indian world's state.
Journalists don't look like creative people who have their own ideas, they look like representatives of institutions and countries, a few writers from China, a bunch of people from Nigeria.
They're waiting for us to adapt to our health care, not to our business.
In 1984, when he took an interview from a writer and a researcher James Solw, they asked him a couple of times about his sexuality.
"And the person who took the Internet came up trying to value him as a blue writer and said, ""You know, I don't have anything else?"" And it's the same with what I have in everything."" When politics tags us, our sense of freedom is under threat."
It's an unbelievable society called a multinational society that has been funded by all the writers that are not published.
About 10 years ago, I remember the first multi-million reading at Harvard University.
We were three writers, a man from the Philippines, a man from the city, one from Indonesia to Latin.
(Laughter) But what brought us together was not our text or text.
It was just our passports.
They're waiting for other writers to write real stories.
In fact, there's a function.
They're not just writers, they're also members of a larger mass.
I should argue that this approach to history is not only in the universe.
That's all over the world.
I saw this for the first time in 2005 when it was taken out of school because of the history of the genocide.
I've been working on writing a great, multi-dimensional story about women's family with their eyes.
My little story turned into a big macro problem when I was assigned to the office.
Because I wrote about the Turk-Americans, some of them were fascinated by me, some of them.
But at that moment, I wanted to tell both sides that this is just a state.
It's just a story.
"I don't want to reduce the value of what I've seen when I say ""Just the story.""
I love and I love it because it's not because of how it works, but because of how it works.
Journalists are known for black reviews, but political books are enough today, and the language of government is not the language of everyday politics.
"Cexov says, ""The right way to do things and the right way to do things is completely different."
"And secondly, it's the job of an artist."" politics separates us from each other. Mathematics unites us."
One of them makes it possible to get rid of it.
It's the difference between the scales.
One takes a picture.
It doesn't define the context.
The politics was made out of the shark.
It's from the water.
"There were people who were talking to a story called ""Madah."" They were going to caves, and they were telling stories that they were very embarrassing in the streets of the caves."
They're changing their voices to express different images in the literature, and they're not shaking them.
He was all going to listen to him, the old people, even the gentlemen, the wives, the extraordinary ones.
"The oceans cross the borders, like the Middle Asia, South Africa, the Balkans and Asia, ""Molla Narrator.""
Today, stories continue to cross borders.
They don't listen to each other when the Palestinians and the Israelis speak, but the Palestinian writer read the book of the Palestinian writer reading the book of the Palestinian writer, communicating with the story path.
Biology has to get us far away.
If you don't look at it, it's not a good job.
The books took me away — for some time, the boy who was embarrassed and embarrassed.
But there's also a problem with budgeting books.
After the writer and the conductor Rumi encountered his soul's wife with the Séms Church, the first job of Samsin was to throw the books of the church into the water and enjoy the destruction of the people that were written in it.
"Because he said, ""It's more than ignorance that doesn't get you away from you."" Today, the problem of diplomacy is not lack of ignorance or ignorance. We think we know a lot about each other, we think we know more precisely. We don't get away from ourselves, we get rid of ourselves, we get rid of others and we break our education."
There's a similarity that I love: to live as a comet's action.
One of the things that you see is fixed.
And the other thing is that it's all about me, it's all about it, it's about it.
That's what my work is.
A part of the work I wrote is that I'm going to go to Istanbul, and the other part is going around the world, and there's a connection between different societies.
I believe that my work is both local and universal, and it's true to us and to us everywhere.
You'll see the House of the Topkaps, which has been the streets of the 14400-year-old ministers.
There's a place in the house that's already called the Chinese visit site from the kitchen room.
It's between the buildings.
I'm very happy to do this.
We don't really believe in the world between life.
We calculate places that are made of extinction, and as symbols of change, we calculate the mass of the extinct creatures, the mass of the deaths.
And my idea is that the public teachers who are in the background should be the media.
I'm privileged by writing change and multiplication.
I love not to think about it after 10 days.
I love my friends fascinating me.
In one of my stories, I can tell you about women who are married, and there's a great chance to be a happy woman who can become a beautiful blue professor from Norway, who's a great friend of my work.
We can talk about everything as long as it comes from us.
"And he says, ""My dad says, ""My dad says, ""I feel, I mean, I don't."" And he says, ""I believe, I mean I'm missing."" It was an example with me."
And I don't understand why, when we're still teaching writing, we're telling students about what you know.
Maybe it's not very good for the beginning.
Creativity doesn't depend on who we are, what we know, and how we have dignity.
We need to teach the audience and each other to write about what we feel open.
We need to get away from the world, we need to recognize other worlds.
It's kind of like the curves that draw all of the things, the curves that run around.
Because they're not dependent on the political situation, they're all unified, and that's the good news.
"I wanted to finish my job with a great water line, ""Let's meet, be friends, let's put things on the road; love; the world is the great world."" Thank you very much."
(Applause)
My big idea is a little idea in which we have hidden millions of big ideas.
This is my little idea to sleep.
(Laughter) (Applause) Here are women who belong to the A group. They're homeless.
They're women.
And I had a very hard deal with the value of the night.
Two and a half years ago, I was tired of being tired.
My head was on the table, my chest was down, and my right eye was shot five feet.
I started to understand the value of the skin at this time.
And I looked at it, and I talked to colleagues and teachers, and as a result, I could tell him that the only way to be better, to be happy is to sleep normal.
(Applause) We're going to win women in this online.
We're going to be the most alive in the real sense of the word.
(Laughter) (Applause) Because it's very surprising that it's considered igility because of less sleepers.
When I was talking to a person recently, he started talking about his bed at four o'clock in the first night.
"I went through my life — of course I didn't say — ""You know."
"If you were five hours, would India be more interesting?"" (Laughter) A lot of people sleep less in the morning."
"If you're here in Washington, you want to invite someone to eat tomorrow, and you're like, ""What's the eighth hour?"" you're going to say, ""It's eight nights, but there's nothing, it's a little tennis game, I'm going to call you a few places."" They think they've already been working and interviewed, but I don't mean, because there's enough leaders who are doing a lot of bad decisions in politics, politics and politics."
It's going to be good.
It's not to be a good leader, it's to be a good leader before it hits the island Titanic.
There are enough asteroids that look like our Titanics.
I mean, Lehman Brothers, if they were Lehman Brothers, they were still giving them.
(Applause) When the kids were seven days, 24 hours of work, seven hours and a half or eight hours of sleep in the morning, they would be able to see what was going to happen, perhaps.
In a period where we're dealing with lots of problems, it's the best thing that's useful for ourselves because it doesn't depend on the place we live, that happiness, happiness and prosperity is the best thing for the whole world.
Again, I'm just going to make sure that to see some of the great ideas, you're going to break your eyes, you're going to break your devices, you're going to explore the power of the night.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I was like a young child with a woman's body.
If you see the brain, you can see that the brain consists of two components of half the brain.
Thank you for a moment. Thank you very much. It was fun. (Applause)
It's an energy-based study that's spreading all of the sensory systems at the same time to see how the indigenous moment looks, how it sounds, how it feels, how it feels, and how it sounds.
We're an energy that's connected to the energy around our right brain through the distance.
At this point, we are perfect, perfect, blind.
The left brain is a completely different place.
On the left-hand side, it's a methodic idea.
And our left brain is thinking in language.
The only thing I could do was energy — power.
"And I said to myself, ""What do you see to me?"
I feel the surface in my body. Thank you.
