I was 11 years old. At one morning, I remember the Indian who played the joy of my house.
My dad was listening to the BBC news at the radio of the whale crash.
I had a surprise that we had never been used at that time, because the study was very sad about it.
"""It was taken back in the Taliban,"" my dad screamed."
I didn't understand what that meant, but I knew how happy my father was.
"""You can go to the actual school,"" my dad said."
It was a night I couldn't forget.
Let's go to school.
I was only six years old when the Taliban gave the school for girls to go to Afghanistan.
So, in the last five years, I had to go as a son to go to the secret school by inviting my abusive father to get out of the desert.
That's the only way we can't learn both.
We're going every day in a different way, so don't worry about what we're going to do.
We put our books into market bags because they just censored that we used to shop.
It was inside a school house, more than 100 men packaged in a fish room.
It was comfortable in the winter, but he wanted to be in the air.
We knew that our colleagues, our colleagues and our grandparents — we all made our lives better.
Sometimes, for the Taliban students, they were connected to school for an amazing week.
We were afraid of what we knew in our right.
You see, are they watching us?
Do you know that we live on Earth?
We were busy, but again, school was where we wanted to be.
I was actually very lucky because I grew up in a family that value education and counted girls on a scale.
My father was a great man for his own time.
He had a different idea that lived in a sub-Saharan region, who was asked to bring her daughter, my mom, to school, and therefore even by her father, she was forgiven of parenting.
But I became a teacher.
It's cool.
Two years ago, he went out of the studio, and he turned our house into a school for girls and women in college.
And my father — that's what — was the first student in his family.
He didn't worry about his children going to be educated, even though he was in the Taliban's health, taking risks.
So it was even more difficult to learn from children.
In the Taliban years, it would come to me, it would be time, it would be time, it would always be in fear, and it would not be light from the future.
"I didn't make my hand sad about everything. My dad said, ""Hey, my daughter, you can destroy everything in your life."
You can be a pollen-paran boy, and you can stop leaving your house in war.
But the only thing that's going to stay with you all the time is here, and if we had to sell your blood so that you could get your school fees, we would sell you and send you to school.
"Okay, are you willing to continue?"" I can't be 22 this day."
I grew up in a distributed country in a decade-long war.
Only six percent of my children were able to finish the middle school, and if my family didn't go so much after my education, I wouldn't look at it.
In fact, I'm based on this, here, as an unbelievable sculpture in your circle.
(Applause) When we went back to the university, one of the first students who taught me was my father who was forced to send her daughter to school.
She's not because I'm a cow, but she's because I'm the first woman to get her in the car at the Kabil kid.
(Applause) My family believes in me.
I have great creatures, and my family is bigger for me.
So I'm the leader of a global college that's intended to educate women, 10 x 10.
So, in a country where women are still risky to go to school, I'm from the founders of Soka, the first yatched school in Afghanistan.
And the most striking thing is that in my school, I see students who are equal to the opportunity in them.
And I see how their parents, fathers, my father did to me, even though they were confronted with all of their daughters.
I don't know to tell you his face and his real name, but he's the father of one of my students.
About a month ago, when he went from Soka to the village, he took them a few minutes to die of bombing on the road.
He played his phones in front of his house, and the voice on his phone kept sending her daughter to school, and the party was going to repeat.
"And he said, ""If you want, kill me down,"" he said, ""But I'm not going to protect my daughter coming because of your unbelievable ideas."" And what I've discovered over time about Egypt is that the fact that some of us have seen by the Muslims — the fact that every one of us in the back of us knows the value of the girl, and the father who is paying for his sacrifice."
It doesn't mean that our mothers don't have the opening of our success.
In fact, fathers are much more analogous than believing that girls are going to come and lead, but in a society like in Afghanistan, they're losing people's lives.
In the Taliban, the number of girls that went to school was measured by hundreds — as you know, it was reported in Nigeria.
In fact, there are more than three million girls who go to school in Afghanistan.
(Applause) It looks very different when you look at Africa from America.
I understand that Americans see the uncertainty in change.
I'm afraid that these changes are not going to take too long after the U.S. military was taken.
But when I go back to Afghanistan and see the children in school and the children who are inspired by them, I increase my hope for a bright future and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and unconventional possibilities, and the girls who are reading in Syria are giving me this again every day.
They're building big creatures like me.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
It's in every wave that's really exciting with me.
It's in the backland.
It doesn't fly. Let's go back.
One. Two. Three.
When you saw the first public school event.
It would make sense of anything.
I was very lucky to see that, as I knew, a lot of South Korea didn't have been so lucky.
He taught a new language, and after he got a job, all his lives could be underneath.
We were all Korean, but after 67 years of separation, after separation.
Am I a South Korean or a South Korean?
So I started planning how to get them away.
It's one I don't know.
This is the symbolic of my life.
This is a child band that we designed in 2007.
We put it on the ground.
It's going to hit an era without being stuck in the roof of the building.
You know, if you're in the hallway, kids really like burning.
This is how the roof of the building looks.
Why did we do that?
"The second minister said to me, ""I don't want to be Syrians."
"And I said to him, ""It's not just possible."" But he said, ""How is it going to happen from the outside of my mother?"
"You're going to fall over the slums."" (Laughter) I said to him, ""No."" And yet, the government workers said, ""The Syrians should be perfect."
We put the idea of the torso around the trees.
There are three trees inside the building.
These grandchildren also allowed us to call surgery.
But it's all used for other purposes.
They're assembled over the house.
The kids are accumulated as they're hungry.
(Laughter) Sometimes there's 40 kids around a tree.
This boy tree that you see in Buddha likes so much that he ate it.
(Laughter) Whatever happens, they're sitting outside the ceiling.
This looks very beautiful from the bottom.
They read the lab zoo to the mosquitos.
(Laughter) It's time to eat.
(Laughter) (Applause) We've been wearing the dam as much as possible, because we want to see the kids not just underneath the dam, but on top.
If the ceiling is too high, it's only to see the roof.
And that's where the foot is — every species has water.
What you can see is that the environment is playing to drink their friends in children, and it's also gray, and it's normal.
But you can see that the boy doesn't take it with the baby and fill them with water.
(Laughter) The rest of the year is completely clear.
There's no waste from water and land.
And that means that architecture is made of wood.
There's no gap between the mosquitos.
There are no acoustics.
Most of the kids are starting to start to get into the hallucinations.
But there's no reason for this connection.
Because there's no slide here.
He says that if he doesn't want to be in his bedroom, he can go out.
It's going to go back, and it's going to go back.
(Laughter) I mean, kids like to hide.
And here they go and they go back again.
This is a natural process.
Secondly, we consider that it's very important to sound.
You know, kids sleep better in the voice.
They don't sleep in the room.
Our children, in our context, have a high concentration in school.
You know, our ancestors are also growing in noise.
They need a voice.
We know that you can't easily talk to your friends about everything in the room.
You don't have to be honest.
We know that at the beginning, we're trying to control everything.
But it's completely open.
I mean, in the winter, we're going to run the ice in the cold.
We're going to be sad on the street.
We're going to wake up 50 times in the middle of the atmosphere.
We don't pass water.
We're in the rain.
So we've been created to be present.
We also have to treat children that way.
And here they're trying to divide the continent.
They actually need to help their musicians.
But they don't.
(Laughter) And this kid goes in and goes in.
And that's the room.
And that's the hands-on.
They're doing good things here.
Most of the trees have trees.
He's trying to keep his mother in the middle of the middle.
(Laughter) You don't. (Laughter)
In the window of every school room, there's a window without anything.
Santa Claus comes from this in a mile.
And it's extra matrix, and it's built along the right side of the vertical axis.
It's about five meters tall, and it's about seven feet tall.
It's very cheap.
We can't think about security.
We give a girl a son to study.
They're trying to get inside.
It's expensive.
It's good, but it's good.
He's my son. He's my son.
(Laughter) Here he's looking at how good it is to get out of the tree.
And then we left other kids.
You know, in Tokyo, it's going to be a lot of waste.
(Laughter) He's trying to learn how the driver is going on.
In the last year, kids need a little bit of care.
In such situations, they learn to help each other.
It's a society, and we have this kind of opportunity.
This chart shows the movement of a son's daughter from 9/11, to 9/11.
It's 183 meters.
It's not fish.
I mean, it's six thousand meters in the morning.
But the interesting thing is still a little bit.
The kids are moving 4,000 meters per day in this context.
The kids here have the highest athletic performance among the ties.
"The second minister always says, ""I'm not going to give them a kiss. They're just like a lot of dogs."
"We're going to leave me."" (Laughter) They're going to run for themselves. (Laughter)"
My idea is that we don't need to control them and protect them from reality anymore, but they don't have to get rid of everything.
They also have to get a little bit of attention.
Because we teach them how to live in life.
I think it's capable of changing the world of parenting and the health of people.
This building is one of the things that was taken to change children's lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In the 1970s, I was in Hong Kong for two years working with gymnostics.
When I went to the first grade, I received a request that all of the things would be done by the government to not go to the athlete School.
"But my grandmother said, ""Yes."" My grandchildren wanted me to be an engineer as well as them."
It was the only way to do well-intended and healthy work is to do well-intended.
I don't love my work, I don't care about it.
But my wish was to be the Chinese opera musician.
That's how I play my real piano.
To be an opera player, I have to work with acronym since I was a young age, and I've come out of my hand to go to the opera book.
I also wrote a book to make a radio show to our school museum.
But the adults didn't hate my idea.
Nobody believed I was serious.
But my friends would have come to me, and they were kind of unhappy kids like me.
So when I was 15 years old, I realized there was a night to go to school.
My dream was never real.
By the end of my life, I was afraid that I was only happy to get my second grade happiness.
But that was injustice.
I decided to find another way.
Nobody's going to show me the way? Oh no.
I wrote books.
"So I invited this book written by the musician family to replace Validen's mission. [""The printing of his family.""] If I asked a woman to be a musician, I took the female model from this work. [""Jen Eyr.""] I learned that I was fascinated by this book, ""The world's cheaper."" The real name is, ""Cheaper by the Dyson"""] These books inspired me to read outside."
"[""Sanmao's art community"" (Applause) [""Tarix lessons"" author: Nan Huaijin] In 1995, what first books did I read when I came to the United States?"
Of course, books written in China.
"""The Great Toraj"" is the Chinese village life."
There's nothing to do with the project. I'm going to cut it down.
It's interesting to the Bible, and it's a little crazy.
(Laughter) This is another day.
"But my fifth sentence made me light, and I said, ""You're going to love dad and mother.""
"I thought, ""Great is different and better than compassion."" So I had the chance to rebuild my relationship with my parents and I had the sense of being guilty in prostitution."
It also gave me the opportunity to compare my reading with my new literature.
This can teach you a lot.
For example, in the first place of this map, it seemed astonishing to me, because in China, we grew up learning this map.
I've never imagined that China is not supposed to be in the world.
In fact, Mars shows a look at the world.
It's not a new thing with modern architecture.
This is a standard practice in the world of mind.
And yet, there's also a field of science, such as a common religion and a common society.
It's helping teachers to understand the whole understanding of the context.
And I thought, well, if you're working for research, why don't you create a daily life?
So I began to read books in the case of cats.
"Let's say, ""Benjamin Franklin"" writer Walter Isaacson, ""John Adams"" writer: David McCullough,"" or the friends of the same story."
"[""Audience writer: Katholine Graham] [""Cartbook: Warren Buffett and Life"" writer: Alice Schroeder] I like to read a story a few janitors — (Laughter) [Music Bible: King James version] [""Cartbook: Christopher Moore] Or Joseph Saul wrote in a series of different stories as he did in his beautiful age, ""Mifin's Power."" Joseph Smith wrote a few janitors; for Jesus and Buddha, they went out of three cases."
For Jesus Christ, they were religious, political and spiritual.
It's interesting for Buddha that all of these were psychology: compassion, fear and social compassion.
It's interesting to read the books that you like, if you know, in two languages.
"[""Chuang Tzu Way"" writer: Thomas Merton.) ""Tuo: Water Age"" writer: Alan watts] In my life, I showed you other interesting facts, not the loss of me."
"Well, with the help of translates, I realized that the whole thing of happiness in Chinese means ""happy happiness"" in me."
"The word coming in Chinese is defined as ""the mother."" Yeah!"
(Laughter) The books play the role of the virtual portal that I know to connect with people in the past and Indian time.
I know I'm never going to be alone or unhappy again.
It's nothing to do with other people's difficulty.
I started to believe that the only thing of desire is not to reality.
The key thing about desire is to ensure that we can connect with the moment where desire, happiness and happiness are created.
And the unrealistic desire can do that.
Because of books, I'm here today and I'm happy, and I'm living with a light thing for a lot of time.
"I say to you, ""The books are always with you!""
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
You didn't talk about it. What we did.
"You're watching him up to his room, and you're asking, ""What's my studio?"" Well, it's the morning of the Saturday, and you're in the office, and one of you're in your office, you're going to see the headquarters."
And I'm talking about something much more valuable than the office.
From time, from time.
(Laughter) It's not to think that the main sign of the radiological syndrome is to accept the mandate of Congress as you see in the court. (Laughter)
"It's a quick talk — bip, click, diet — in your audience, ""I'm going to go, I'm going to wait for Congress."" (Laughter) The class is important, isn't it?"
Compassion is the beginning of getting into every company.
And a law that's going on in the right can actually give you a real amount of value.
We're crying. (Laughter) That's not the reason that the guy can't do a good job, but that's why DRS, that's what we've created without thinking.
In fact, I'm convinced that DRS is global epidemic.
Let me talk to you.
A few years ago, I posted a video on YouTube, and I've imagined all the bad things that you might have in this video.
It's about five minutes of video cliping all of the things that we hate about bad news.
There's a law enforcement officer who doesn't want to control the climate.
Companies who don't know why they're.
And he left all of his stories in a sense of ignorance.
It's funny.
(Laughter) Let's not look quickly.
(Video) Today, our goal is to get compassion in a very important case.
Oh, Joe. I'm working home today.
(Laughter) Oh, Joe. Thank you for being interviewed.
So, as a group of people — (Laughter) (Laughter) Oh, who was stuck?
Right? You're going to say to me. (Laughter) Do you know?
Well, he's also meeting me.
A couple of weeks after putting this on YouTube, 500,000 people from tens of countries, really tens of countries, looked at this video.
And three years later, this video takes thousands of views every month.
But the women who don't see, they laugh when they listen to the human population.
"I'm Michael Shermer. I'm a friend of the skeptic's ""Skeptic.""
We're looking at paranoid events, psevdo-elm, interested groups and sentences. These are theories, the psevdo-elm, the abstractions, the theory, the theory, the theory, the bad elm, and so forth.
If you don't live on Mars last time, then you're confronted with things like this.
Some of us call us a cartoonist in my neocortex.
But let's admit that car capture has a lot.
We're like the police officer's headquarters, and we're trying to find them and find them, and we're like the bad ideas, the bad ideas. (Laughter) We want to change bad ideas with good ideas.
Let me show you an example of a bad idea.
I've brought it with myself. It's given us to test NBC Datel.
It's a company called Quadro in Virginia.
"It's called ""Quadro 2000 A-Flightball.""
(Laughter) They sold it to school managers for 900 dollars.
It's a plastic thing that's installed on the radio Shack antenna.
It can be used to search for a lot of the tools, but it's three things to search for the student's education in the school.
(Laughter) It works like this: When you're in the corridor with this, if you go back to the joke, you open the box.
That's something.
I'm going to show you.
(Laughter) Yeah. This is a little bit of fruit to go back to the right.
We're going to do this again, because we're doing science.
We believe it's going to go on this side.
(Laughter) Mr. David, you've left your cows without compassion. (Laughter)
Now, the main question is, does this device know that it's a superconductor in shock?
And the key is, well, if you open enough, you can find it.
(Laughter) (Applause) We should not only watch what we found in science, but watch what we didn't find.
And the point of the short story here is, you know, that's what the astronauts, astronauts and astronauts are always using.
People remember what they found, forget what they didn't find.
We record everything in science. We compare the number of people who have been found in science.
That's what we did here.
We took two boxes, one of them to a British THC college college student, and we put that one out of space.
And 50 percent of the trials have been rewarded. (Laughter) And we're going to get this results at the grandfather.
This was an interesting, small example of what we did.
"The ""Skeptic"" paper is published in three months, and every single article is published."
It's about the future of the woman.
When people come, the network is broken, right?
And I have a certain idea to come up with my wife, and you can see that when people come to the network.
Every decade, the average IQ has increased three numbers.
It's very interesting.
Don't think about skepticism or science as a material thing.
Are they in science and religion?
It's a question of the symmetry of the cosmos with the theory.
These are two different things.
It's not science, it's business.
It's hard to think about things.
For all the phenomena, natural explanations are the way it extends.
"So what's more real? Is it going to go far away from other galaxies of the world's spiders, or multi-dimensional creatures, to create Bob's second stage in Canada for ""skeptic.com"" ads?"
Or is one of the skeptic readers going to do this with thePhiloshop?
The main question, if you want, is what explanation is more real.
Before we say that life is in a different world, we should be confident that it's not in this world.
"Can it be more real? Will Arnold be able to help the astronauts to be a comedian?"" Or does the World Wide Web News show that?"
(Laughter) This is what he found in the cartoonists of Sydney Harris.
"And I'm going to read for the people in the Archie, ""And then there's a miracle."
"You're going to explain the second pill better."" This slide destroys all the networks of design."
That's what cartoon does.
(Applause) You can say to the USDA, but that doesn't explain anything. It doesn't give you an idea.
It's not going to happen.
It's the end of the poem for the creators of the design.
To give you a sense, teachers sometimes call it dark energy, dark matter, and when you think about what's happening, it's called this.
It's the beginning of the wisdom for me.
And for the design of the network, and for the research of the technology, this is the last part of the window.
Again, the same question comes out. Who is more real?
UFOs are the cars of the astronauts, or are they the crabs or the crabs?
This is an UFO image taken from my home in Atlanta to Pakistan, California.
It's reading this piece of paper, right? Because it's a piece of paper.
"It's called ""Philoshop,"" it doesn't need high technology, it doesn't need software."
"I've taken this picture with the ""The Milky Way"" machine."
No one was ready to stand in front of him.
The camera was ready — that's how much.
(Laughter) You can think that many of these are true, or even if they're in isolation, some of them are real, but they're all very unlikely.
If we take it more generally, we're always looking for a gap between the testimony and the theory.
For example, there were two problems when the astronauts led the telescope to Saturn.
First, there was no theory about planets.
Secondly, we kept the witnesses and we were mad, so he couldn't really deal with what he saw.
"And he wrote his eyes like this: "I've discovered that the planet far from three objects.""
He decided that this was what he saw.
So, you can't put good planets into good theory without theories, with the unprecedented data.
That's what happened in 1655.
This is a book that Christian Voygens collected by the people who were trying to deal with Saturn.
These were two things that were true to astronomy, and there was a good theory about planets and solar systems, and there was more accurate telescope data, so we found that, according to Kepler's rules, the Earth explodes faster than Saturn.
And with this telescope, we also saw the parts of the galaxy.
And that's the theory that's undermining it.
The bad side of the literature is, it knows it's full of science fiction.
One of the reasons why we believe in the truths of humans is that we're just arguing that it's worthwhile, and then I'm going to deal with serious reasons.
We've been tempted to see snow everywhere.
This is Mars.
In 1976, NASA was asked to take other pictures of the same place, and people thought it was a father created by marbles.
Budur is a picture taken recently in 2001.
If you cut your eyes, you can break your face again.
In short, you turn your eyes into a more unusual image, so you reduce the quality of data.
If I don't say you should look at the landscape, you would see the face, because we were adapted to self-assembling and recognizing the face.
It's important for us to be social.
And of course, it's ridiculous. It's easy to see all kinds of snow.
Here you see the smile of Mars.
(Laughter) If astronomers were to be in the building, they would also see the Kermit in the universe.
Look. Have you seen the whales?
Or if geologists were flying ...
It's iconic.
(Laughter) In 1996, he found a crab in Tennessee.
He would take five dollars from the people who wanted to see the rabbit's hole, until the rabbit got a warning from the origin of Terez.
Here's the audience in Washington and Watsonville, small down. Is it small in the morning?
It's very important to do this, because there are fuzzy, fuzzy, nectar lenses, and as you can see these pictures on it — people are the animals that are fuzzy.
This is the view of Sao Paulo on the edge of the window.
Here, I'm going to show you the ice in the pendulum sendow, and I've known it to the crash in Las Vegas. Yeah, the ocean is in America.
(Laughter) It costs 28,500 dollars to buy this sendow from eBay. (Laughter)
So who's going to read? Let's look at it? (Laughter)
They've been burned, and they've been in the temple of the 1940s.
I'm going to look at the water in Florida.
And I've come to see that.
There were a lot of people.
It's a very faithful person who has come in with real cars, with the trees that we've come in.
We've been interested further.
So you know the measurement — this is Dawkins, I and my great Rand, based on the image of two, two, a half-dimensional height.
People burn thousands of shams in the sense of compassion.
We went and looked back to figure out what was successful.
Now, you know, there's a picture like this in places with fontans and grass trees.
This is the view of the Mars on the other side, and they started to see it.
Anyway, most of a building can be a miracle.
(Laughter) This is actually the mystery of Mars, or the mystery of Mars? (Laughter)
And I'm going to finish with another example of this, and I'm going to finish with the summer season.
"There's a film called ""The Red Voice,"" and Maykl Kiton plays, telling us that the dead are talking to us."
When we come to the world, talking to the dead doesn't really mean a lot of difference.
It turns out everyone knows to talk.
It's the answer to death that's difficult.
(Laughter) In this film, guya has these messages hidden in electronic events.
I uploaded them from a magazine called reverseSpeech.com.
This is the most famous.
That's the record of that famous prison.
(Laughter) If you're older, don't worry.
May is a beautiful summer.
If two ways are separate, it's time to change the way.
Now, let's talk about it. Can you see the secret message with you in the word here?
(Music and unintended words) [Satan] — satan.
(Music and unbelievable words) What did you hear? Audience: satan!
The hell? You don't know the least the hell together.
Now I'm going to tell you what you need to listen to your brain's hearing, and we're going to listen again.
I'm going to finish with a little, beautiful and beautiful story.
"""Skeptics"" is an extraordinary institute."
We're looking for all the things that people are doing right now.
In English, there's a pop musician.
It's very famous in England: it's called Kate M.
There's a very, very bright universe.
"It was between the five best people in 2005, and it's called ""Doh million vel vel vel vel velcroed."" It's a love story — it's considered Norah Jones in Britain, and his loved son, even two and a half million velcroods, is a woman who loves it very much."
It feels like this in their words.
(Music) (Laughter) We were 12 billion lights away. This is the moon. No one can tell you that this is true, but I can tell you that I'm going to be with you forever.
Spiker: Yeah. It's at least close.
"In America, this would be, ""We're six thousand light miles away from the ocean."" (Laughter) My friend Simon Singer, is a mathematical physicist, and he's a scientific scientist, and he's a writer of the book ""The Great Partition."" It's worth all the opportunities to make good science work."
"So, in ""The Guardian,"" he wrote a paper about the story of Cassie, where we know exactly how far we are from the probe."
We were 12 no, 13,7 billion lights away, and that's not the hope.
We know exactly how much it is, even if it's possible.
So, even if it's not exactly right, we can say it's very close to the right number.
And it turns out that after the summer, Emma invited her, and she said, I'm very sorry, I've become an astronaut club.
I had to keep my hand. He wrote his hand.
And I'm going to end with that.
(Music) We were 13,7 billion light miles away from the universe that knew we were a client.
It can be a lot of money, but it's the nearest number that's done.
And by looking at the data in our hands, I'm going to make sure that I'm going to be with you all the time.
(Laughter) Right, you know?
(Applause)
In the 1980s, if you had a text machine in the communist Church, you had to pass it out of prison.
The example of a paper written in the machine was not to go out of the box.
So the government knew the origin of all the books.
When they found a paper that had a moral idea, they knew the author of this thought.
And we've calculated that in the U.S. as an unprecedented, unprecedented, unprecedented issue.
We would never have done that in our own government.
But today, in 2011, if you print anything with any famous brand's laser diameter device, the yellow dots of the left are automatically scalable by a certain sequence that's just on your printer and the printer will be different from others.
This is the reality of our day.
Now, there are many people who don't want to do that.
It's an example of what our government uses from technology to us against its own citizens.
It's one of three major global problems.
And when we look at the national problems, we see the national attacks that certain groups are dealing with.
These attacks are divided into three major groups.
The first, they're the nine-year-olds.
In this way, it's like Kirri Qolubov, who is from the U.K. city of Abu Dhabi.
And it's not very difficult to understand the causes of genocide.
These guys get money.
Many, many, many, they're attacking nationally to get a lot of money.
In fact, we've seen millions and millions of people with national attacks.
This is Alexander Tsasts from the city of Estonia.
This is Alfred Ignzalez.
This is Stephen watt.
This is Norman Sundin.
This is Matthew Anderson, and he's Al-Qaeda, and he can extend his black.
These guys get their services online, but they do it in extraordinary ways, and when we run online, they use things like banking viruses to get back from our bank accounts, or when we're using a virus computer online, they collect our credit card data with textbooks.
Two months ago, the U.S. secret secret secretary department gave a account in the Swedish bank, a member of the U.S. government called Samsak, who had 14,9 million U.S. dollars on the Dondark account.
No one knows that Sam Jein is on the map.
I mean, today, we have a greater chance of being a humanitarian disaster than the real world.
And it turns out that when the situation comes, it gets worse.
When it comes, the vast majority of studies are going to be successful.
The second big group of non-governmental attacks is not the reason why they're doing that.
The reason they're trying to see this could be the reason they're trying to see it, the reason they're trying to think about it, the reason they're laughing.
So groups like Anonymous have grown over the last year, and they've been starting to be a major place in national attacks.
I counted two of the three main attacks: these are the hackers who are doing this for the police, like Anonymous for the police, and the third major force is government and government.
Let's not look at what's going on in companies like the U.N.
It's an unprecedented example of what happens when governments attack their own citizens.
It's a series of research inventors in the Netherlands — in fact — that's true.
They were told last year that they were in the 19th century.
No one went into their systems and the whole system broke out.
And I asked the Dutch State Department last week in a refugee, and I asked him this question, and I asked one of the government officials that I didn't believe and believe that the destruction of the universe was caused by human death.
He said he believed.
What if people die of such an attack?
It's the U.N. Organization.
They sell the online certificate.
What do they do with the sermon?
If you have a textbook based on the data, and you need this certificate if you want to use a service for SMS encryption, as it is in Guatemala.
We use more than Google or reading, but it's more popular in countries like Iran, and in these countries, people use more than the U.S. government, like Google, because they can't control local government agencies than they've been hacked, like Google encryption, than they've been hacked.
But it's the U.S. rating that offers these services.
It's possible to distribute the list of companies.
That's what happened to the U.N. company.
How do you do that in the Bahamas and the Bahamas, and what do you do in the Missouri?
In the mission, in April of 2011, the prisoners broke the headquarters of the secret police of the missile, and they took out a lot of papers to search for the picture.
"And among these papers, there was a benefit from the beginning of the ""FESPR."" And within this file, there were reports from a company that was very familiar with the U.S. to the U.S. government that sold tools and programs to keep all of their services under control in the U.S. government."
These tools were sold to the Minister of Mission to 280,000 aversion.
The CEOs of the company are right here.
In short, the U.S. government provides it with devices that allow the dictators to keep their own citizens under control.
But the government governments do it to their own citizens.
For example, a couple of weeks ago, there was a virus that was called the British virus, which was created by the German government, and three were created to detect their own citizens.
If you're innocent, it's important for everyone to listen to your phone.
Now, it's more than that.
They're going to get your connection to the Internet.
They can go through your computer, control your entire organization, listen to your national work, learn your passwords.
"A lot of people who talk about these kinds of issues are very likely to say, ""Okay, it's not a good job, but I'm a woman who has a law, it doesn't have a lot of impression to me."
Why am I worried about it?
"I don't have anything good."" But that's a very crazy idea."
It's privacy.
It's not about the museum.
It doesn't depend on the choice between security and security.
It depends on the choice between care and care.
And that's what we believe in our government on this day of 2011, and that's what we're doing if we're going to get rid of our government.
But can we believe that in the future, in the last 50 years of the case, we can also believe in our eyes?
And this should be the case and the case that will hurt us in the next 50 years.
(Music) (Applause) Thank you for being here.
"And I say, ""Thank you for being here,"" because I was in the hospital for 17 years."
And I said these first words in Washington, DC, the 20th anniversary of the Earth's Day.
My parents and friends were gathered together to listen to me.
"I said, ""I'm sorry you're here."" And my mom screamed out of the auditorium and said, ""You know, Johnny's talking."
(Laughter) Imagine that you've been in the 17 years of school and your mother's kind of crazy behavior.
"My dad said to me, ""That's the thing."" I'm going to deal with it."
I looked at me, because I couldn't understand that my voice came from the map.
"I didn't hear my voice over 17 years, and I looked around me and I said, "Oh my God, who's the one who's asking me what I think?""
And then I realized, this is me and I'm going to laugh.
"And my father said, ""Well, he's going to go back."" Now I want you to go to this journey."
And even though it's an extraordinary thing of life, it's all of us.
I believe it will be metaphor for our lives, and I also want you to not think about your own life.
My journey begins in 1971, when I witnessed the collapse of two shipping vessels under the Golden Gate, then half a million balloons were broken blindly.
It made me so much influence that I decided I wouldn't use the tools of engineering.
This is a big thing for California.
This was also a big thing for the small Point 360 station I lived in Inverness, where 350 people lived in hardasa in the fall of the 1970s.
And when I came to me, I started walking on the piano, people — they knew what it was going on.
"They asked me, ""John, what do you do?"" And I said, ""I'm going to play for the world."" And they said, ""No, you're doing it to hate us, right?"
"You're going to do this because you don't bring us bad still."" Maybe they were honest, and I thought, when I was walking on the piano, people would get me off."
Because it's all about the ocean.
He talked about it, and I was talking about people who were involved in this situation.
I invited my grandchildren.
"And I said, ""I don't use it anymore."" My dad said, ""Did you do it to anybody when you were 16?"" (Laughter) I didn't know about the environment at the time."
They lived in Philadelphia.
"And I said to my mother, ""Oh my grandmother, I'm very lucky."" And she said, ""If you don't want to say that, you don't need to say that."" Mother is like this."
So, on my 27th birthday, I decided that — because I've lost a lot of poetry, and I've talked a lot — I decided, I'm going to give advice, but I'm going to make a day, a day.
So I did that.
When I fell out of the morning, I didn't talk about a break.
And I say, it's been a great experience for me, because for the first time, I started listening to this time.
And what I heard was that it made me think.
Because, I always thought, I'm listening to people, and when I listen to people, I'm going to join people, I'm not going to listen to them anymore when they want to talk about.
And when I was crying when people were talking, I was telling them, and I was thinking about what I would say when they were talking.
And then ...
And so the unit ended.
And that day, I was really listening.
And that was a great thing for me, because I realized I didn't learn anything over the years.
I was 27 years old, and I thought, I know everything.
But I didn't know.
So I studied this for the next day, and then again and again and again, this time, and I promised to myself that I was in a year's life because I was already starting to learn, and I needed it.
So I didn't talk a year ago, and then I thought, in my day, I might start talking again about some of the things I've learned.
But it took 17 years.
I went to the piano for 17 years, and I went to the studio, and I was also working on writing my book of generosity and day, and I was trying to study the book by reading the textbook.
And I thought, I need education.
I went to Ashland, Oregon, where they had environmental programs.
It's 800 miles away.
I went to the office and — what? What?
I showed you the hand in the audience.
Ah, do you want to read here when you're born?
How about it?
We have a special program for you. They did that.
And after two years, I ended up with the rate of looking at it.
My dad came. He gave me a gift.
"He said, ""Listen, my son, we're giving you, but we don't know what to do with this bakalarium degree."
"If you don't drive a car, if you don't talk about it, if you don't do it."" (Laughter) And I took my white bag, and I started walking again."
I went to Port Townsend, Washington, and I went back from the tree here, and I drove it through the Great Sound, from Idaho to Washington and from there to Missoula, Montana.
Two years ago, I went to the University of Montana, and I didn't read it.
It wouldn't be bad to stay here for two years.
(Laughter) And that's what happened. I graduated in college for two years, and the military gave me a lot of help.
There are two stories in Montana.
The first one is that when the paper came, my pulse was lost.
"And they said, ""Don't worry about this."" The president of the Institute said, ""Come back in the morning."" He gave me 150 dollars and said, ""Go out of school for a school."
"Do you go to North America, hell?"" I said to her — air and snow, hydrothermal systems, North America."
So I did that.
"He came back and said to me, ""Okay, John, you can take the door of the office and use it as a student for a lecture."
We're also going to allow you to participate in all of the professors.
"It's easy to get it, and it's easy to get it, and it's easy to solve the future, and then you can get it out of the classroom, and then you can get it out of it."" Well, it's not exactly what's happening in the middle of the world."
They wanted to help me, and I wanted to help me.
They saw that there was a lot of trouble in the environment, and they tried to help me in this way.
And in this period, I've come up with lessons without talking.
I had 13 students when I first entered the school room.
My friend translated my hand signs to them: John Francis's name, I go to the piano — I told them that I'm not going to be more transmitted — that's the last lesson.
All of the students in the audience ...
(Laughter) To get out of the world, I saw the sun's feet.
But I had to tell them that picture.
After two weeks, they all tried to get into our office.
I've learned a lot in this school — when I do these kinds of things.
"He was all thinking, ""What's John trying to say — I don't know, I think he understood that the tree was cut off."" Well, the tree was cut off."
No, no. It's not that — it's the result of the arm.
Who you're with your hands?
You can get someone in the world.
Well, that choice is talking about prostitution.
So, this was the challenge, and we decided to do it.
I was taken back from this work, and let's say, I went away.
But what I learned was that when I showed a signal, they were telling me the meaning that I didn't really understand, but I had to keep it up.
And I thought, if you're a student and you're a college student, and if you don't learn yourself, you're not going to be a good teacher.
So I went on.
"He came to my father's release ceremony, and my father and I said, ""We're giving you, but ..."" And we know the next one, and he said, ""You have to start driving and talking about cars."
"What do you think about doing with the Magister Diplome?"" I took my Chinese, threw my bag in my pocket and went to the University of Wisconsin."
I've been there for two years by writing about the textbooks.
Not many of you were interested in the health care workers.
But he did something — Exxon Valdez.
And I was a young man in the United States who wrote about the law enforcement.
My father came again.
"He said, ""My son doesn't understand how they do, ""If you don't use the mouse, you don't talk."
"My father said, ""You need to leave you up, because if you're going to make a better thing you see."" (Laughter) I got my box back to me."
I took my trip, and I walked across the coast of North America, and I sent my legs to the Atlantic Ocean, and it took me seven years and a day to travel to the United States from this beginning.
And in 1990, I started to dive on the 20th anniversary of the Earth's Day.
And so I've worked with them, because it's not the case that there's no man from the audience when the trees fall down there.
And I thank the soldiers and my family because they came to listen to me.
And that's the unit.
And they taught me to listen — they listened to me.
And that's something that didn't come from that box — listening to each other.
It's really important — we need to listen to each other.
My life continued.
"My dad said, ""That's the trick,"" and I didn't expect it yet."
I worked as a coastal journalist, and I became a great minister of the U.S.
I wrote rules for the U.S. — rules for law enforcement.
"20 years ago, if anybody said to me, "John, do you want to make a difference from birth?""
""Well, I want to make sense.""
"They said, ""You start to go to the right place, you fall out and you start to the right place."" And after a little bit of land, they would say, ""Hey, you're going to eat."" (Laughter) My friend, you want to make sense."
How does that happen? What?
How do we deal with real things like walking and talking to the market?
It was a great time for the coastal community.
"And then — I worked here for just a year — I said, ""Well, it's enough a year to see this work."" I took a great trip, and I went to the Caribbean desert, and I traveled all the islands in the army until Venezuela."
The great thing came out of mind — I'm not going to tell you why I started talking to you.
I started talking about it, and I learned about the environment of the spider.
I've learned about the environmental engineering in this case — formal business, but there was an informal innovation.
And non-formal soap — I've learned about people, what we do, and what we do.
And the environment isn't just for trees and birds, and it's not for growing plants, it's transforming each other because of our relationship.
And if we're around, then we all look around us and see our behavior against ourselves and each other.
And that was what I wanted to do.
"And I said, ""I've got to bring this insane to other people."" And I was sitting in my long run, and I was walking through my career — that was my own turn, and I was working on it — I went to Venezuela and I started walking."
This is the end of the story, and I realized I wasn't there because I didn't use it yet.
I traveled through El Dorado — it's a famous prison city, or a Russian prison — in Venezuela, and I don't know what happened to me because I didn't know what happened to me.
"And when he went through the mosque, the judge told me that he was leaving me — ""Slaporte, pasaporte,"" and he threw M16 out of the mosque."
"And I looked at me and I said, ""passport?"
I'm not going to show you a passport, it's my box.
I went around the world, and I left the rate, Dr. Francis and I.
What made me stop saying that?
The road went back to the horizon.
They made me laugh.
What am I going to say to God because I'm forgiven and I thank God because I am forgiven?
After we walked 150 kilometers, I realized that when I was making it, I was turned to my office.
I was in prison, and I had to escape.
I didn't use the medical care tools, and it was the prison that I was in.
What would happen?
Because when I started, it seemed like it wasn't enough to use it.
But the difference was that every day, I was asking myself desperately, but I was never asking myself to use my feet.
That's not how I was going to be a minister.
I wasn't crying to be a professor.
And so I realized that I only had other questions than myself, and that's why I had to change.
We know, we can do that.
I was in a way to change.
And I was afraid of changing, because I've always learned to be traveling.
Because I learned to prisoners who didn't want the end.
I didn't know who I was going to be when I tried.
But I knew that was necessary.
I knew I had to change, because this was the long way to be here today.
And I know that many times, we find ourselves in a place where we always want to stay, but there are other places to go for us.
And we don't have to go to the place where we're going to have a new identity, where we're going to have the stability of our identity.
And I'd like to thank you for not going to that next place — take you out of the prison you've seen inside of you to the place where it's as comfortable as you know. This day, we're going to do something on this road.
We should not change.
We have to be honest, as we said in the last week, as we've been in the White House.
And if my voice affects you, if my life affects you, if it affects you if I'm here, please do that.
I know, when I'm here, you can all affect me.
Let's go to the world — let's take this origin, this love, this humility with us — here's TED time showing each other the humility that we're showing to the world with ourselves.
Because we're environmentally engineered, and our moral behavior means our environment's behavior.
So because you're here, I'm going to give you a chance, and I'd like to close my interview here for five seconds.
Thank you.
(Applause)
"It turns out that if you rely on any small size in America, a structure gets closer to you and says, "Look, what's the name of this block?""
"And you say, ""That's a little Oak, and that's a little science."
"It's 26th, it's 27th."" He says, ""Okay, what's the name of this block?"" You say, ""It's not the name of the block."
"There are the names of kids, the blocks are just a non-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-
"So let's show you that if you're a little bit in Japan, you're surrounded by my island next to me, "Look, what's the name of this little boy?""
"He says, ""This block is 17 and the code of that block is 16,"" and you say, ""What is the name of the young boy?"" And he says, ""The children don't have names."
They have the names of blocks.
Look at Google Maps. There are 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
All of these blocks have names. It's a non-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-zero-sum block.
"And you say, ""Well, how do you get your home mail?"" And he says, ""That's very easy. This is the fourth Ray."
"This is block 17 and home number one again, and when you ask, ""Okay, when I went around, I check it."" He says, ""Okay, we're going to go, and they're going to do some of the amazing things that they're going to do."
The first house in the block is number one.
The second one that's taken after that is number two.
"It's an intersection. It's the Earth and the moon."" I often love it most, that we have to go to that part of the world to see that most of us can't understand what we're never thinking about."
For example, people in China think that their job is to keep you safe.
In the months you're given, you're paying attention to the staff, and if you're sick, you're not paying attention, because they're not going to get out of their work, they're going to happen when you're safe, because you're sick.
"In many musicians, we calculate the race to start ""one"" music. One, two, three, four."
"The Amma Prize shows the end of the ""one"" piece of music at the African Museum, like the moment at the end of a sentence."
So, it's not just when you divide it into the senses, you see it on the number. Two, three, four, one.
And this is true.
(Laughter) I mean, whatever you know about India is true.
So let's never forget how you're idealistic at TED or elsewhere, or if you've heard it, it might be true.
Domo arigato gozaimashita.
