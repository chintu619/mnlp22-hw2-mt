By the end of this year, there will be about a billion people on the planet who are actively using redesign.
All of them combine what they're going to die once.
Where this is a horrible thought, but I think it has serious consequences that should be seen.
For the first time I thought about it after I was posted in Dirk K. Miller, a science-tech journalist who died from cancer.
Miller asked his family and friends to write a puzzled post which was published after his death.
That's what he wrote at the beginning.
"He said, ""Oh, I died, and this is my last post in the blog."
"So I asked, as soon as my body would get rid of the kick of cancer, my family and friends publish the prepared message I wrote as the first part of the passage of my blog from active into archiv."" Not surprisingly, as in a journalist, Miller's archives could be written better and more accurate about, the matter that today everybody create archives that are totally different from what was created by any previous generation."
Let's look a little bit of statistics.
Now 48 hours of video are downloaded on YouTube every minute.
There are 200 million Tweets per day.
The average Facebook user creates 90 units of content per month.
If you think about your parents or grandparents and grandparents, in the best case they created a couple of photos, or home videos, or a diary lying in some box.
But today, we create incredibly rich digital archives that will live in clouds unknowingly how much time after our death.
I think it creates incredible intriguing opportunities for technicians.
For clarity, I'm a journalist, not a technician, so I'd like to press the picture of what the present and the future will be like.
We've already seen some services that allow us to decide what happens to our online profils and revelations in redesign after we die.
One day one of them, quite a year old, found me on tea in a bubble of New York Restaurant on Foursquare.
(Applause) Adam: Hello.
Death: Adam?
A: Yeah.
Death: Death can kill you anywhere at any time, even in Arganik.
A: Who is this?
Death: Go on ifidi.net, [""if I die.net"] until it became too late."
(Laughter) And: It's fair, isn't it true?
This service makes quite simple things: it allows you to create a message or a video that can be published on Facebook after you die.
The second service is called 1,000 memories.
It allows online to separate proper loved ones and complete it with photos, videos and stories they can publish after you die.
But further it's just interesting.
Many of you probably heard about Dave Rayo, who wanted to predict how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video.
I think with improving the ability of machines to understand human language and design huge amounts of data, it will become possible to analyze content for life — Tweets, photos, videos, blog posts — which we produce in large quantities.
And I think as soon as this happens, for our digital individuals, it will be possible to continue interaction with the real light after our death, thanks to expanding the entire content we created, and the ability of technology to give that meaning.
Now we'll look at a couple of experiments.
There's such a service — My Next Twitter, he analyzes all your records in Twitter, everything you sent, and makes predictions that you could write next.
Yes, as you can see, the result may be comic.
Imagine what something like this will look in 5, 10 or 20 years with improving technical capabilities.
By doing a step forward, MIT's laboratory media works on robots that can interact like humans.
And if robots could interact based on the unique characteristics of a person, on hundreds of thousands of units of content that a person created for the whole life.
Finally, remember the famous pictures in the U.S. election night in 2008, when the C.C. studio was broadcast to the hippie speaker of the CEO Will.I. Am'a for an interview with Anderson Kuppé.
And what if we could use this technology to projecture calculating our loved ones in the hotel, interacting very realistic, based on the content they created while they lived?
I think it's totally possible, since the volume of data that we create and technical capabilities for their analysis increases in geometric progress.
As a result, I think we all need to think if we want it to become reality? And if so, what will it mean to raise life and what on.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The second exception is from the head of the government
Unfortunately, the answer to these questions is yes.
After that, you can do predictions and test them.
What do we know about complex systems?
It means that literally the system is not composed of its parts.
Where are economic networks?
We concentrated on my mobile networks.
The quality of companies is determined
"How are they organized?" "They decoupling ourselves?"
These are companies working in more than one country, and there are 43,000.
I'll explain by analogy.
More specifically, I want to talk about what's wrong in how we talk about love.
I don't know the track of you, but when I imagine this method, I see a stage with a cartoon — as if this person is here, he goes on the walk without observing, he comes to the open person and silently falls into the channel.
And I imagine it exactly like this, because to go is not accelerating.
Tenderness is sudden and uncontrollable.
It's something that happens to us without our permission.
I'm a writer and also an English teacher, which means, thinking about words, I earn for life.
You can say, and I'd like to emphasize that many methods that we use to talk about love are perhaps even a major part of them have a problem.
So in love, we fall.
We're angry.
We're growing up.
We fall in poverty.
We remember the fire.
Love makes us crazy, and it makes us sick.
Our hearts are afraid and then they break.
So our methods make up love with someone to excessive violence or illness.
(Laughter) That's exactly that.
And they position us as an eye of unexpected and inevitable circumstances.
"My favorite one of them is ""smitten," which appears in the past form of the word ""smite."" And if you look at the meaning of this word in a dictionary — (Laughter) you see what it means and ""solutely misfortune"" and ""Be strongly in love."" As a rule, I associate the word ""smite"" with a very special context, with Old Testament."
"So in one Book of Excuse, there are 16 sentences to the word ""rahing," which in the Bible is used for the mosque of the angry God."
(Laughter) We use the same word to talk about love explaining our six breakfasts. (Laughter)
Right?
So how did it happen so?
How did we come to the association of love with big pain and suffering?
And why do we talk about this kind of good experience as if we are victims?
These are hard questions, but I have someories.
And to find out this, I want to focus on one concrete method that reflects love as shame.
When I started studying romance for the first time, I met these methods of madness everywhere.
In the history of Western culture, there are rich languages that bring up love to mental disease.
Here's a few examples.
For the first time I fell in love at 20 years, and it was enough unpleasant relationships since the beginning.
It was a relationship on distance the first few years, so for me it meant very high flights and low underwear.
I actually remember one moment.
I sat down to bed in a hotel in South America, and I saw my loved one come outside the door.
It was late, it was almost north, we did after dinner, and when we came back to our room, he left his things in the bag and pulled the press.
Even though I don't remember the causes of this obstacle anymore, I remember very clearly how I observed his leaving.
I was 22, it was my first trip in a country that was developing and I was completely alone.
Stay a week before my flight home, I knew the name of the city in which I was, and the name of the city I needed to get to fly, but I had no idea how to investigate around.
I had no Chinese witness and very little money, and I didn't know Spanish.
Someone more courageous than I could scale it as a moment of opportunity, but I missed it.
I just sat there,
And then she was crying.
"But despite my breakdown, some little voice in my head thought, ""Wow. It was dramatically."
"I really love right way."" (Laughter) Because some part of me wanted to feel upset in love."
Now it sounds so strange to me, but at 22, I tried to have dramatic questions. At that moment I was unconscious, angry and disappointed, and it was pretty strange, but I thought it would somehow reflect my feelings to a boy who had just left me.
I think at some level I wanted to be a little angry, because I thought, that's how love and work.
"It doesn't really have to be strange, taking into account that there are eight movies, 14 songs, two albums and one novel called ""The Great Love."" After a second hour he came back to our room."
We fell asleep.
But love someone in this way — as if my prosperity was entirely dependent on the reciprocity of love — was not very good for me or for him.
But I think this kind of love is not very unusual.
Most of us feel a little confused at the early stage of stagnation.
In fact, there's a study which proves that it's normal, because, neuromy says, stagnation and mental disorder aren't so easy to differentiate.
It's really true.
"This study of 1999, uses blood tests to prove that the rate of serotonic love is very similar to the rate of serotonic in people with the diagnosis of ""Absolutely-Compulsive Disability.""
(Laughter) Yes, and the rate of serotine is also linked to the syndrome of hoocial effective disturbance and depression.
So there's a few evidence that love is closely linked to changes in our mood and attitude.
And other studies suggest that most relationships start in this way.
Researchers claim that the low degree of serotine is linked to an opponent thought about the object of love, which нагаes the feeling as if someone fell in your head.
And most of us feel like when they fell in love for the first time.
I decided that if my friends can't understand my troubling mountain, I don't need their friendship.
So I stopped to meet most of them.
And it was probably the most miserable year in my life.
But I think I felt that being misfortune is my job, because if I was misfortune, then I could show how strongly I loved him.
And if I could show it, then we would finally stay together.
It's a real crazy thing, because there's no universal rule that states that big suffering leads to a great reward, but we talk about love as if it's true.
Our experience of love and biological, and cultural.
Our biology says that love is good, activating a row of rewards in our brains, and she says that love is frightened when, after stress or dissolution, the neurochemical prize is abolished.
In fact, probably, you've heard about it — talking about neuromy, to experience separation similar to getting from caffeine that I'm in common.
(Laughter) And then our culture uses a language to form and conform this idea of love.
In this case, we talk about the methods of pain, addiction and madness.
It's a pretty interesting exchange of feedback.
Love is powerful and sometimes frightened, and we show it through our words and stories, but then our words and stories prepare us to wait for a strong and terrible love.
Interestingly, it's all happening in a culture that shines my life.
By being we want from an early and crazy love, and we want it to keep her entire life long.
It sounds horrible.
(Laughter) To control this, we need to change our culture or change our expectations.
Imagine that we all would be less passionful in love.
If we were more confident, more open to the new, more cheerful, and then instead of falling into love, we would come into it.
I know that it takes a lot of things, but I'm not the first man who offers it.
"In the book ""The Metaphors we live"" the linguists Mark Johnson and George Laykaph suggest an interesting solution to this detail: we need to change our metaphers."
They claim, and they can even act as the leaders of our future jobs, as the prophecy that progress.
John and Laykapp offer a new metaphor for love: Love as a collective art.
I like this way of thinking about love very much.
The linguists say that metaphers follow the logic that, in essence, and there's a way of looking at all the subjects, or ideas that contain in the metaphors.
John and Laykapp talk about everything that collaboration on art is preventing: exile, compromise, patience, general goals.
These ideas are well suited to our cultural inclusion in long-term romance relationships, but they also work well in other kinds of connection — short-term, casual, free, immensely, unconscious — because these metaphors bring much more complicated ideas in the experience of someone's love.
So if love is a collective art, then love is an estetic experience.
Love is unpredictable, love is creative, love requires collaboration and disciplination, disconnected and winning emotional exile.
And love is composed of compassion and pain.
In fact, every loving experience is different.
When I was young, then I never thought you could not take everything that offered love.
When a quarter-year-old Judith met for the first time — or if a quarter-year-old Judith couldn't be without Rome, with which she met four days ago, she was not disappointed or admired.
Where is she?
She wants to die.
Yes?
And as a reminder, at this moment of drinking, action third out of five, Rome won't die.
He's alive, he's healthy, he just pulled out of the city.
I understand that the 16th century War is similar to modern North America, but when I first read this pizza, too, at 14 years, the Pat of Judith had a meaning for me.
Transcending love as something I create with who I'm fascinating, not what just happens to me without my control or consent, it gives the inner power.
But it's still hard.
Love in the early times is absolutely irrelevant and devastating, and when I feel upset, I have to remind myself: my task in these relationships is to talk to my partner about what I want to do together.
It's also easy.
But it's much better than the second option in which love is madness.
This is the version of love not about being attracted or losing any attention.
Instead, she requires trust to her partner and measure the situation when trust becomes difficult to sound very simple, but in fact, a revolutionary radical action.
Because you need to stop thinking about yourself and your purchases or losses in these relationships, and start thinking that you can offer.
"This version of love allows us to tell things like, ""Hey, we're not very good collaborators. Maybe it's not for us.""
"Because, ""These relationships were a curse than I was planning, but it was still amazing."" The total art was good because he doesn't reduce or miss himself."
This version of love allows us to decide how it will look.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Sunday in the 95s, I was another student with my friend driving a car from the City of Providanse, which is in the city of Roud Айланд, to the city of Portland, which is in Argentina (Single 5000 miles).
But you know how it goes when you're young and unemployed — we didn't go through the masterways, the bottom of the national parks, the national vacant, the king say, the longest way.
I came back to my friend a week in South Tokyo, after 3000 miles, and I asked me that I had been traveling around 3000 miles already.
"What is this behind the characters that are everywhere along the road?"
Her eyes were out on the bed.
Mr, sitting in the first place very precisely now falls her facial expression.
(Laughter) So here I said to her, "You know, these signs along the road that with the Chinese characters." She'll catch me a few more moments, and then she fell in a laugh, because she finally understands,
What this is me about.
(Laughter) Here's he, this famous heroic place for pizza. (Laughter)
In the past five years, I thought a lot about these situations — why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around, and how we behave when unconscious happens, and what we all know about the nature of the human.
In other words, I spent the last five years in thinking about the state of failure.
My career choice may seem to be not obvious to you, but it has a huge advantage: the absence of the contest to the workplace.
(Laughter) In fact, most of us would run from the fire from thinking about their misfortune, or if they would try not to think about the possibility of their need.
Absolutely we understand that.
We understand that sometimes everybody in this room is wrong.
We are people, we have the power to be wrong. Okay, let's go.
But when the matter looks like me, at this moment, my conviction in this data time, suddenly all the abstract views of human need to fly before, and suddenly I can't imagine what I'm wrong.
What's interesting is what we live exactly in this data time.
In it we go to meetings, in it we want to go to vacant, in it we go to the warn and give our voice.
In practice, it turns out that we all run through life in a box of belief that we always have the right.
I like this a problem.
In my opinion, it's a problem like each of us, at a personal or professional level, as well as us all together as a society.
What I want to know today is the first floor because we're mistaken in the sense of our rule.
Secondly, it's why this approach is problematic.
And finally, I want to convince you that it's possible to get out of the skeleton of this sense, and if you add it, then it's the best of all the sight of shouting into morality, intelligence and creativity that you can do.
Why do we get tired of feeling of our listening?
One rise is linked to the sense of misfortune.
Let's ask you, can you, because you're here next. What are the emotions coming out if you're not wrong?
Accessibility. Disappearment.
Integrity. Okay, cool, super.
Compassionate, with a uncomfortable feeling, with a sense of comfort — thanks, they all are file answers, but they answer the second question.
You answer the question, "What feeling causes understanding that you're not right."
(Laughter) Realizing every mistake makes yourself feel like it was said, and still the whole spectrum, isn't it?
For example, there might be a terrible feeling whether it's a feeling of deepening understanding, or even a cheerful feeling like my silly Chinese characters.
But the condition of misfortune itself doesn't cause any emotion.
So here's an analogy for example.
Remember the multiverse of Lucius Company, where is such a missionary plane all the time to run, but does it never match the running escape?
Almost in every episode of this series, it happens that the boat is going to hang behind the escape and that flew out of the left corner that's not difficult because the escape is a bird, and can fly.
But every time the boat flew out of the rocks now just after the escape.
What's funny, especially if you're only six years old, is that for cats it's also unpleasant.
He just keeps running until he looks at the dollar and does not understand what he sees in the wind.
Here then he starts to fall.
When we're wrong in something, not if we understand what we're wrong, but to that, we're like this jacket, after the rocks but to the look down.
You understand, we've already wrong, we're already going to get to deal with it, but we still feel confident on the ground.
I need a bit to translate what I've ever said.
There's a feeling in all misfortune — it's feeling of their rights.
(Laughter) Because of this structured conclusion, we're ever involved in the sense of our rights.
I call that mistake blind.
Most importantly, we don't have the inside of a mechanism that would answer if we're wrong till we know.
There's another reason why we care of this feeling, it's more about culture.
Imagine a little early school.
You're a sister, and the teacher returns the control. One of them looks like this.
Actually, it's not mine.
(Laughter) So here's you're in your school, and you know exactly what to think about one classman who has received that degree.
He's stupid and shit, he's never doing homework.
So, yet to the age of nine, you learned that, first, those who are wrong are linear, neglected tattoos, and secondly, to achieve success in life, you can never be wrong.
We study these wrong words very much more human.
Most of us, and as I think, especially in this hall, rely on such learning, become unpredictable rewards, perfectionists, lovers.
Isn't he, Mr. CEO of finance, as an astrophysician, he's the same super marathon?
(Laughter) So as it turns out, you're all such directors, astrophysics and marathonists.
Let it be.
The situation is worse only when we're doing that we may have wrong in something.
Because thinking in this way, when we do a mistake, we decide that something isn't like us.
So we insist on our own, because so we feel reasonable, accountable, well-being and protective.
Let's tell you about the case.
A few years ago, in a hospital called Beth Israel Deaconse, a woman accepted for surgery.
This hospital is in Boston.
In this hospital, students go from Harvard, and he's one of the best in the country.
This woman was taken and engaged in the operating room.
She was put under the drug, the surgeon is manipulated over her, after he charges her and advances her to the post-operative palace.
It seems that the operation went normal.
The woman starts, she looks at herself, and she says, "Why am I not bound on that side?" And she's bound on that side, because the surgeon did a serious operation on her left, not on her right.
When the hospital's intentions were told as a processor about it, he said something very interesting.
"On the unknown reason, the surgeon simply felt that he was working on the right side." (Laughter) Why I tell it, so because believing your sense of being at the right side of something might be very dangerous.
This inner sense of all the listening that we all experience sometimes cannot be trusted as the only thought of what's actually happening in the outside world.
And when we're in our behavior being focused only on such a water and even don't think about the possibility of our misfortune, we're making stupidity like cutting 360 million pounds of oil in the hall of Mexico, or neutralization of global economy.
It's a giant problem for practice.
But this is another giant problem for society.
Think for a minute what means the feeling of your rights.
That means your beliefs listen to reflect reality.
With this feeling, there's a problem that's an explanation to all those people that are incompatible with you.
It turns out that most of us have explained for themselves people with other views using the string of wrong thoughts.
The first thing we usually think if somebody with us is misconvenient is that we admit they're not aware in the data question.
They just don't have access to the information that you have, and if you're a glimpse of this information with them you share, to them will come, and they turn into your camp.
If it doesn't happen when we get sure they have the same facts with us, but continue to mention with us, we move in the side of the second thought — it's what they are ideas.
(Laughter) They need all pieces of composition before them, and they can't, they're cute, they can't collect them.
And if it doesn't work, if we realize that people who don't mention with us have the same facts and yet they're quite reasonable, we're going to the third opinion — they know the truth, but for their own criminal purposes, the value of this truth is turning away.
This is a disaster.
This advantage of us to reject our rules doesn't give us to avoid mistakes, especially when it's compulsory, and makes us bad each other to stand up.
What makes me more stand, I think it's tragic, that this condition is absolutely distracted from our human essence.
By being, we want to believe that our minds are these unimaginable transparent windows that we can carefully observe them and exactly describe the universe.
And we want everybody to observe the light through the same glass, and see exactly the same.
It's the same thing, and if it were, the world would be incredibly boring.
The miracle of our mind is not that we can see the world he is.
He is that we can see the world not as there is.
We can have memories of being, thinking about the future, and we can imagine if we were other people in other places.
It's because everybody sees a little different, we can observe the same squirrels of the next sky and see it, and that, and that, and that.
That's why we're wrong.
In 1200 years before Dickert made his famous words "I think and mean exist," the lord named St. Augustine wrote "fallor ergo sum" — "I'm wrong and meaning exist."
Augustine realized that the fact of our ability to be wrong is not the indiscreet defect of the human system, nothing to prevent or destroy.
It's the core of our humanity.
Because we're not God, we don't know what's done in this world.
Unlike other animals, we are constantly trying to capture this world.
I think it's an unbelievable distance — it's a root and an output of all our productivity and creative imagination.
Last summer, for different reasons, I started listening to a lot of publishers of the program "This American Life" on the social radio.
I listened, I listened, and the silence began to feel that all the comprehension was about reading misfortune.
At first, I thought, "I fell in love.
Now I always see misfortune as crazy.
She looks like me everywhere." There was a genetic blessing.
But how many months later, I had the ability to take an interview into Iris Glass's curriculum.
I shared this opinion with him, and he said to me, "It's really that."
He added that programmakers even joke that in every release, this is the same subject-shirf.
She goes somewhere so, "I thought that something would get like this, and it really happened differently." "What's interesting," added Iris Glass, "Thank you what we need that information.
We need such moments of failure and changes of failure to live these stories." What's like us all, the audience, as listeners or readers, as stories to us like this.
We like the transformation of this, the creative steps and the unpredictable ends.
What's about our stories, we want to be wrong.
But you know our stories are so, because our lives are so.
We think it's going to be so, and it's actually going to happen differently.
George Bush thought he would attack Iraq, find there a weapon of mass destruction, liberate people and trust the democracy of the Middle East.
And it really happened differently.
Also, Hans Muobrac thought he would be Egypt's dictator to the end of his life until he was getting up and growing up, and then he would be able to transfer ownership to his son.
And it really happened differently.
Perhaps you've ever thought you would stand up and get up with your loved school, come back to your home city and predict how many children together.
And it really happened differently.
I have to admit that I thought I was writing the latest book about something that nobody has a deal to, for readers who never will be.
And it really happened differently.
(Laughter) That's the same life.
We're developing incredible ideas about the universe, sometimes — to a better lead, sometimes — no. And the world is prevalent and fascinates us.
Don't cry, but all this conference exists as a monument of our possibility to be wrong.
We've spent a whole week talking about innovation, improvements and transformation, but you know why do we need these innovations, improvements and transformation?
Because half ideas that were crazy interesting and had the opportunity to change the world — look at TED in 1998, what else there is —
(Laughter) didn't work, didn't it? (Laughter)
Where is my perfect costume, Chris? (Laughter)
(Applause) And we're here again.
And so will it continue.
We'll find another idea.
We'll tell another story.
We're participating in another conference.
The subject of today, as you've already heard 7 million times — how to find wonder again.
I mean, so if you really want to invent wonder again, get out outside this tiny and fearful space of your right and look at each other, also look at immortality, completeness and mysteries of the universe and let yourself say, "But I don't know yet.
Maybe I'm wrong." Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you all. (Applause)
On October 5th, a man named El-Said Nahar entered the hotel in Montreal and killed Mary Khan's rabbi, the leader of the Liber Liberation of the Hebrew defense.
At first, Nazi recognized the unknown in the murder, but when he and his collaborators were punished for other crimes, he and his collaborators began planning attacks on a series of celebrators of New York, including panels, synagogues and the chief of the Organization of the United States.
Fortunately, these plans were made by the FBD inflarator.
But unfortunately, the explosion in 1993 in the World Trade Center failed to interfere.
As a result, Narcissor sentenced to participate in the capacity.
El-Said Natar is my father.
I was born in Petersburg, Penn State, in 1933, in a family of Egyptian engineer and a mastery mother of American, the teachers of early classes. The parents together tried to make my childhood happy.
But when I was seven years old, the relationship in our family began to change.
My father showed me the same side to Islam that little people should have to see, including even most Muslims.
My experience shows that when people meet each other, they don't need much time to understand that in principle we all want each other and the same.
However, in every religion, in every nation, there will be a small percent of people who are so fanatic adhering to their beliefs that feel the need to use any means to force others to live according to their rules.
In a couple of months to detention, the father put me and told me that several last weekend he and his friends went to the London Island Street for a coach.
He said I'll go with him next morning.
We went to the Calverton Street, which the FBD was internalized.
At that day, my last astronaut ran into a small orange lamp on the top of the mosque, and, to all-always surprise, and especially my, all the mosque burned the flame.
"My grandfather came back to friends and said in Arabic, ""I'm an ABRAHAM." Who's the father, that's a son."
They all felt this forever very strongly, but only a few years later, I realized her meaning completely.
They saw me the same destructor as my father was.
As a result, those people were condemned for the fall of the truck, which was trained by families with kilograms of explosion in the underground park of the north side of the World Trade Center. This explosion led to death six people, wounded over a thousand.
These were the men on which I was meeting.
"These people I called ""am," which means ""Thank you.""
Every time I started to feel comfortable in one place, it came time to show things and move into another city.
Being always a new face in the classroom, I had often been a misfortune of fluogans.
I learned to judge people based on random circumstances like religion or race.
What opened me my eyes?
The first event that ended up knocking out this image of thinking had happened during President elections in the 2000s.
Through the preparation program, I was able to participate in the National Youth Out of Philadelphia.
Members of our group introduced the most different plaques of society.
One day, near the end of the journey, I learned that one of my new friends was a glimpse.
I had never had friends of the Hebrew yet, and, honestly saying, I was proud of turning the barrel, in the imperfectness of which I believed almost all my life.
Another breakthrough moment was the summer development in Bush gardens. It was a park of attraction.
There I saw people of the most different beliefs and cultures, and this experience was found fundamental in setting up my personality.
The frequencies of blood that have been spent in childhood took me into the sense of compassion for others, and for me, it's not necessarily to stand up to other good people as I wish to stand up to me.
This feeling allowed me to compare the stereotypes that taught me in childhood with a life experience.
And then there was The Daily Show. Every evening, John Steart made me be honest with myself following my own fanatism and helped me understand that racism, religion or sexual detention didn't have anything common with attributes of personality.
In many ways he replaced me the father in which I then needed this.
Encouragement often comes from where you don't expect him at all, now I understand well that the Hebrew comic has contributed to my worldview more positive than my father-extremist.
One day I talked to my mother about how I began to change my worldview, and she told me something I'll keep in my heart all my life.
At this moment, I realized how much negative energy is needed to contain this unknowable inside myself.
Because Abraham is not my real name.
I took him when my family decided to break up the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why am I to open my person and potentially underpinned myself by danger?
Anyway, it's just.
Instead, I use my experience in fighting terrorism, in fighting fanatism.
I do this for victims of terrorism and for their parents, for a terrible pain and loss which has fallen on their part because of terror.
In memory of the victims of terrorism, I'm speaking against these misconvenient actions and judging my father's actions.
I'm standing here as evidence that violence is not an indirect part of religion or race, and that the son is not bound to follow the way of his father.
I'm not my father.
(Applause) Thank you all. (Applause) Thank you all. (Applause) Thank you all. (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause)
But it can't be so.
I'm the one who likes chocolate pigs.
I learned everything ago in these 30-day experiments.
This picture from my challenge when I did by photograph every day of the month.
I never liked beautiful,
She's horrible.
They are actually the greatest.
(Applause)
I'm incredibly delighted to be born in a country which is considered the best place in the world to be a woman.
In 1975 when I was seven years old, women in Iceland went out to a vacant.
At that day they didn't work, regardless of whether they had a job or just a house business.
They went to the Ricky Center, 90 percent of the women attended, and they were silent and solidarity asking about equality.
Nothing worked in Iceland that day, because nothing works when women aren't.
(Applause) Five years later, Iceland had the courage to become the first country in the world that democratic way picked a woman as president.
I'll never forget that day when President Higgs, known in us by name, went out on the bathroom of his house, the mother alone with her daughter, after his victory.
(Applause) She became an amazing pattern to change for me and anyone who grew up at the same time, including boys.
She often told a story about a boy who came to her after a few terms on the table and said, "And guys can also be president when they grow up?" (Laughter) The role models really have a value, but even with such strong transformations that I'm very grateful when I suggested to ball on the president's post, my first response was, "Who am I so much to fight on this post?
Who am I like to be president?" It turns out that women are less likely to press on the position than men.
A study conducted in the U.S. in 2011, showed that 62 percent of the men examined their candidate for president, but only 45 percent of the women.
We see a breakdown in 16 percent, and it's the same breakdown that was there a decade ago.
It's a real shame, because I'm sure that this world needs leadership women and more fundamentally leadership at all.
So my decision to beat finally was that I felt the need to make my contribution, even without any political quest, get forward and try to take part in creating a world that would have a meaning and give three for our kids, in which we really let and guys, and girls achieve everything they want.
It was the journey of my whole life.
It was amazing.
The journey began with 20 potential candidates.
After the graduation, the number was connected to nine candidates, and finally the race came to us four, three men and me.
(Applause) But this is not the drama yet.
Perhaps you think there are dramas here in the U.S., but I can — (Laughter) I can say that we're not worse in Iceland.
At first, the president, whose last 20 years, imagined that it wasn't going to pay, it might, and led to such a number of candidates.
And then he thought when our prime minister came back to the report because of the sadly famous Panama papers, in which he and his family were involved.
There was a popular prostrate in Iceland, because where the president was arrested that the country needed a recognized leader.
And a couple of days later, the relationship with his wife and her family was also found in Panama papers, and he left the race again.
Before he left, he explained what he does it, for now there are two skilled men who can become his annual tracker on his seat.
So nine September, 45 days before the election, the matter looked not too well for me.
I didn't even catch a place in the newspaper chart.
According to a survey, I had 1 percent, but all of the same, it was the highest position among women who attended.
It's going to be a change to say that I've given the example of all the efforts to get my place behind the desk and get to TV, because the television decided to integrate only candidates with a minimum 2.5 percent of the voices in the interviews in the first TV.
On the day of these debate, I found that I would take part there with three men, and during the era, I learned that I got an eye of 2.5 percent a day of the first debate.
(Applause) And about problems.
The fundamental problems that had to meet and deal with on this way were linked to media, support and play.
Let's start with media.
Some claim that sex doesn't mean for media and politics.
I can't agree.
I found it harder to get both access as well as effer time in the media.
In fact, the leader candidate appeared in the public media 87 times a couple of months before the election, while I appeared there 31 times.
And I don't say the media does it consciously.
I think the reason is in a unknown page, because in the media, in a larger part, as well as everywhere, there are conscious and unknown pages, and we need courage to talk about it when we want to change.
When I finally got access to TV, the first question sounded like, "Do you plan to remove your candidate?" It was a hard question.
Of course, with a result of 1 to 2,5 percent of your voices in the interviews, you can understand it.
But media really matters, and every time I came out on TV, we saw and felt a rise in interviews, so I don't know by listening how important it is, and why we should talk about it.
I had one of the four final candidates never had an interview at the first place.
Sometimes I was left behind the questions that were addressed to all the rest of the candidates, and beyond the light of choices.
I've met it, but I'll say a computer to Iceland media.
There was almost no comment from the case of my hair or costume.
(Applause) Let them write.
But there's another very important experience.
I was proud as a independent candidate without any political party or support.
This lack of experience and access to resources may have been expensive beyond our company, but also allowed to introduce new and do politics differently.
Our company was positive, and so we may have changed the tone of choices for others.
I'm in this reason for less time on TV, because I wanted to show attention to other presentations.
When access to media was extremely difficult, we launched our own information tools.
I conducted online interviews on Facebook during which I answered any choice questions.
All the questions received together with the answers, we put into open access to Facebook because we believed in the importance of using if you wanted to set up trust.
When I found a problem to pay attention to young players, I started using Snapchat.
Pray showed me how to do it, and I used every Snapchat filter during the last part of the company.
I really needed a lot of rubber and rooms, because I was a prophant here.
But, thanks to this, we have grown the number of refugees among the youth.
It turns out that it's possible to know the company and in other ways.
Unfortunately, we can't talk about politics and we can't remember money.
It's sad that it's all right, but it's true, and we had less financial resources than we had other candidates.
Perhaps the reason partially was that, in my opinion, time was misfortune to ask about financial support.
And perhaps I tried to do more with smaller costs.
Some say it's very afternoon.
But even with a third media and financial means, and only with a entrepreneur but a wonderful team, we got to surprise everyone in the day of choices when the first numbers came.
I surprised myself as you can see on the picture.
(Laughter) So the first data says, I went together with a leading candidate.
(Applause sounds) Well, too early, because I couldn't win, but I took the second place, and we went a long way from one percent to almost the third part of my voice, we decided examining an unprecedented breakdown, the result was 10 percent larger than the last investigation.
Because of this, some call me a real winning of choices, and many people invited me to beat again.
But in fact, I'm forced to reinforce my knowledge that I've earned propartively more high rate of support from the youth, and a large number of people encouraged my daughter to beat in 2030.
(Applause) Now she was 13, and she had never been on TV yet.
But on the day of elections, I had ever seen her on TV, she was smart, sure, she was honest and supported her mother.
Perhaps it was the greatest moment of my company.
(Applause) But there was another one.
During the fallout, the girls of the sick age saw my post on the bus station and were burning necessary to kiss him.
Audience: Oh!
This impression is already a victory for me.
We can achieve everything we see.
To the black fear and problems.
(Applause) Women in leadership need, and it's time women to pay, let it be a leader or president.
"I also managed to imagine your native magazine New Yorkker."" And I had a new title, "The Real Mind of Truth."" (Applause sounds) Maybe this is my most popular title, because women are too often punished for the benefit of emotional capital as I call it, but I know from my own perspective that we're going to win when we do that."
(Applause) And we need to use it more.
On the day of elections, we celebrate if we won, because so we felt ourselves.
It's imperative to get this post.
You just need to go on it, and you, your family and friends, all who are going to work with you if you work well, then grow up above all you have experienced before.
We spent a good time, and I'm rich why I learned during this trip, more than I can tell you on the present meeting.
But be sure, it was a hard job.
I didn't sleep much during those months.
We needed courage and empathy to avoid leaving, and I finally realized what I knew yet on the day of one percent: you can only be able if you listen to yourself really and act according to this internal voice.
As my good sister speaks, you can undermine your intuition, but intuition never undermine you.
I also want to emphasize, and you all know this, in any of your voyages the key is your team.
People are motivating to share your values and sight, but differ in the other.
For me, it's a form of success, I'm blazing by a wonderful husband who's here today, a incredible family... (Applause) and great friends, we went out as entrepreneurs on a political order and made something, by people's words, impossible.
In fact, the main public-connected specialist said to how I took a decision that would be good if I get 7 percent.
I examined his point of view, for perhaps he had the right, and founded his opinion on an valuable question.
But on the day of one percent, I decided to show that he was wrong.
It's very important to know it, because I've really been very little asleep and worked perfectly like people next to me.
We're never able to achieve a lot if we're going to forget the question about ourselves.
I think in this fact, very important two points are to attack themselves with people and things that saturate you, but not least important, if not any more, to have the courage to avoid people and actions that pick up your energy, including wonderful bloggers and comments.
In this, I fully supported others, and I decided not to turn attention to the abrasions, partially because my energy was hacked for all that time.
When I lost energy for some moment — and it happened time from time to time, because it was not easy — I was turning into my thoughts to my reasons to ballet, and not just so, but by my rules.
I called our 4G company, where the letter G means Icelandic words.
The first one of them is "Gagna." I was proud to do good, to be useful, I wanted that the conception of leadership as service was the center of our work during the pre-profit company.
The second word is "Gloud," or joy.
I decided to do this trip.
It could be taken a lot of him, no matter whether the purpose point was reached.
And I did all the efforts to inspire it to others.
The third word is "Gagna." I was open for all questions.
I didn't have secret, about everything you could learn on Facebook or on our websites.
I think by choosing the president, you deserve answers to your questions.
The least important word of the end that we don't have to explain in this room, we're a big company according to the principle Girlpower, a woman's power.
(Applause sounds) I'm incredibly glad that I found the courage to fight to risk getting rid, but get success at many levels.
I can't say it was simple, but I'm sure, and I think all my team would agree, it was worth it.
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
Pat Mitchell: I'm not going to leave you yet. Hall Thomasitzer: What good listeners. PM: I can't leave you without saying,
that perhaps everybody in this room is ready to go to Iceland and vote for you.
We'll probably have the right to voice there, but there's something we can take in Iceland, as well as before, it's an inspiration.
I mean, it's old enough to remember 1975 when Iceland's women went out on the street, and it really became a big factor when the launch of a woman movement.
You've been sending to this event before. Let's return the picture to remind yourself how the country that went into the pipeline looked like.
And you can't know, because the American media did not report about it, but on Monday, the Israeli women went out again on the street. Yes?
HC: Yeah. PM: Can you tell us about this?
HC: 41 years since that pause, we can consider the best place in the world to be a woman, but our job has not finished.
So on Monday, at 14.38, women in Iceland left work, because it's exactly in that time they earned their daily salary.
(Applause) It was really powerful that young girls and boys took part in larger amounts than before, because it was time to remediate the breakthroughs in the salary.
PM: I'm not going to ask Hall now about her future plans, but I'll tell you will have a huge well-being army if you decide to do it again.
Thank you, Hall.
HC: Thank you all.
(Applause)
In fact, I tried to think about my career since I left the White house, and the best example I have is the utility in The New Yorkker a couple of years ago.
"The little boy looking at his father says, ""Tata, when I grow up, I want to be an ex president."" (Laughter) I had a great glimpse like a president, because I had access that few people in the world had ever to meet people from all over the world."
They interfere with these rules to persuade that women are generally taking their drug positions compared to men in the eyes of God.
So they published an imagery which, in essence, interfere women with being priest, staff, economics in the church, or clergy in the arm when a woman learns at the classroom in South Baptist seminar, she can't teach if a boy in the room, because you can find a poem in the Bible, and in the Bible more than 30,000 verse where it is said that a woman doesn't have to teach a man, and so forth.
But basically, it's what the books are wrong interpreted to keep men in a more high position.
Why should I pay them the same reward for exchanging the same job?
In the U.S., for example, we had a huge increase in the choice of poor, basically dark people and minorities planted in prison.
Now, 7.3 people from 1,000 are in prison.
It's a serial increase.
Since I left the White house, there was an increase of 800 percent of dark women in the dark.
We're one of the few countries on earth, which still has a mortal generation, which is a developed country.
We're now in California, and I learned a day that California paid 4 billion dollars to judge 13 people to death penalty.
One of them is the abrasion of the palace organ.
Sometimes, in more extreme cases, they lock the refugee so that a girl can
And then, when she's married, the same break opens the window so that you can take sex.
It's not a rare thing, but it's also against the law.
In Egypt, for example, 91 percent of all the women living in Egypt today were sexually dismissed in this way.
In some countries, it's more than 98 percent of women who are subjected to the achievement of their status.
It's a terrible poverty for all the women living in those countries.
Another very serious thing is, where a family with a wrong explanation, there is nothing in Koran that puzzles it — kill a girl with her family when she was violent or when she married or sometimes even when she nose
It's made by members of his family, so the family becomes a killer when a girl brings so called shame to the family.
Not so long an analysis of the UN was conducted in Egypt, and he showed that 75 percent of these murderes of girls are committed to parents, children, or brothers, 25 percent of the deaths are committed by women.
The other problem that exists in the world in dealing with women is slavery, or a crowd of people, as it's called now.
About 12.5 million people were sold to the New World yet in the 19th and 18th centuries.
30 million people live in slavery today.
The U.S. State Department has to give a debt every year, and the State Department reports, through international limits every year, 80 percent of those sold — women who get into sexual slavery.
In the United States, at this point, 60,000 people live under a genotype or in slavery.
Atlanta, Georgia, where the Carter Center is, and where I teach at EMU, between 200 and 300 women, people
This is the place number one in the country because of that.
There are also many passengers in Atlanta.
If a burglar owner wants to buy a girl who has a useful they can do it in 1,000 dollars.
A Belarusian girl to bring the average boss of birel in Atlanta can earn about $3,000 from robbery.
Sex-Glandel in Atlanta, Georgia,
This leads to one of the worst problems, women buy and sell in all the countries of the world.
Sweden has a good approach to it.
About 20 to 20 years ago, Sweden decided to change the law, and women are no longer examined by the law when they're in sexual slavery, but the owners of the burglar, the cousins and — (Applause) — the Constitution went on a legacy.
In the United States,
On one man arrested 25 women were arrested in the United States.
Canada, Ireland, I've already said, Sweden, France and other countries move now to that,
It's another thing that can be done.
We have two big institutions in the country, our army and a great university system.
The army is analyzed.
The last example I received says what happened in the arm is 26,000.
Only 3000, much more than one percent, and the reason is that a team of any organization is a ship, like my underwater boat, or an ecope in a marching pencil — a team has the right by the law to decide about building a criminal deal and, of course, the last thing they want that under their team in this way, they don't do that.
This law must be changed.
The Justice Department says, at the campus area is done because outside the university system, when they violate somebody, but when they find out at the university campus,
They're not examining.
These are things that happen in our society.
When I became President, the difference was 39 percent.
So we've achieved some progress, and so forth — (Applause) (Laughter) — but in the last 15 years, there was only about 23 or 24 percent of the difference in the past 15 years.
That's what's happening now.
If you take 500 companies, 23 of their directors, with 500, and those leaders, I'll tell you, earn in the average less than the rest of the leaders.
That's what happens in our country.
Another problem with the United States is we're the most dominant country on earth.
We were in the state of war exactly since the Second World War.
Sometimes our soldiers were on the place seen.
On the other hand, we flew over the heads, shaking bomb on people.
Sometimes, of course, now we have no pilot,
We were in a state of war with 25 different countries or more after World War II.
For four years, I won't tell them we didn't war — (Applause) — we didn't kill any bomb, we didn't shoot.
But anyway, those things, the return to violence and the wrong explanation of holy scriptures, are the key reasons for violence over women.
Another fundamental reason, Al Gore, men to swallow.
(Applause) That's true.
A normal man who can say: calmly takes a favored condition, it's very similar to when I was young when disappointment and equality coincided.
But for this time there was a lot of white people who didn't think that discrimination was acceptable, but they were mad, because they used privileges of unique access to the court of proper, better schools and all the rest. That's the same thing that exists today, because the usual man, in fact,
"And even when they say, ""I'm against discrimination, they're using a random condition."
What's the fundamental thing we should do today?
I would say, the best thing we could do for women from powerful countries like this, and where you're born, Europe and so forth, who has the effect to take responsibility on ourselves to be more persuading to end racist discrimination in the world.
But I hope that after this conference, women persuade their men, about violence in college campus and in the army and etc., and in the future on the work market, they need to protect their daughters and unkind.
I have 12 sons, four children and 10 truthers, I often think of them, and about the bitter condition, not only if they lived in Egypt with having equal rights, and I hope you all join me to become champions for women around the world, and protect their rights of man.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s, the future of the world seemed dead.
The explosion of population growing was not to stop.
The global hunger was inevitable.
Cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to cut our lives.
The cold rain flame over the woods.
The oil was over, and the nuclear winter would end up to us.
With me, my average life duration increased by 30%.
Child death has fallen by two third.
Producing food for the population has grown for a third.
Death by step on a graph detects the population's death, and this graph shows GDP per person.
In other words, you need to understand how ideas end up with sex.
I want you to imagine what way we went from creating such objects to creating those.
Of course there were some changes, but the device changed slowly than the skeleton at those times.
It's a brilliant phenomenon, but it's true.
At the time the object is done in five years.
And more than that, with a combination of different ideas — ideas of plastic, ideas of laser, ideas of transistor.
They were united together in this technology.
And it's a combination, it's a combined technology that intrigues me. Because I think it's the key to understand what's happening in the world.
My body is also a combination of ideas: the idea of skin cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of skin cells.
They gathered together.
How does evolution do something reciprocity or unified?
She uses a pale disconnection.
One is dying to survive the other.
In the species with a palace disconnection, it's possible that a person get in the legacy of the lunch mutation on different lines.
So here's sex allowing people to overcome genetic innovations of all kinds.
It doesn't interfere with personal nature.
What process has the same effect in cultural revolution that sex has in biological evolution?
I think the answer is exchange, the habit of exchange of one thing to another.
This is the unique human risk.
No animal does that.
It might be such a sexy culture.
In Esperanto, box has culture.
They teach each other traditions that are translated from parents at the same time.
Shimpanzees play have different cultures in different games.
There is no exchange of ideas between them.
So why does exchange raise life standards?
The answer came from David Ricardo in 1817,
I write his opinion in a version of the Common Age, which he also explained in terms of trade between countries.
Adam produces a wild in four o'clock and a sequel in three hours.
Oz produces a wild in one hour and a sequel in two hours.
Oz is better than Adam in a piece and a sir, and wild.
He doesn't need Adam.
He can do his own holes and axes.
Adam and Oz separated by an hour of their time.
If you start first, you need to go to the village.
How long do you have this zombie? Have you spent a lot of time.
How much do you now have to work for an hour of nightlight to read if you have the average wage in UK?
The object of the matter was made for me by other people.
How exact a man did it?
Thirty? Hundreds? Thirty?
You know, I think, millions.
And this way society works.
That's what we've achieved as biological feedback.
In early times, when you were rich, people literally worked on you.
498 people cook him dinner every day.
In fact, there are other animals working on each other.
Smiles are a classic example;
The Queen is responsible for nature.
(Applause) When did these behavior start?
But I don't have evidence of that.
And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides.
And the man knows that he doesn't have to bite to take a picture.
They were a highly cooperative species.
They were a very clever kind.
But there's no evidence that they had a palace division of labor.
There is no evidence of gathering among women.
It looks that women were hunting together with men.
Also, there's no evidence of exchange between groups, because found among the neanderthals of objects, the tools they did are always made from local materials.
For example, there's a place in Costa where local Neanderthal devices were found.
They're always made of local cream.
When a man began to shift objects in such a way, it serve as evidence that they were shifting between groups.
Gandhi is ten times older than earthquake.
And the early evidence of this is found somewhere 80 to 120,000 years ago in Africa, where we see that obsidian, jasma and other objects are passing big distances from Ethiopia.
Also, cancers, as were invented here, in Oxford, went 200 miles of a mammic angle from the Middle Sea Algeria.
And that's evidence that people's groups started exchange.
And that led to specialization.
What happens if it limits people from exchange, from the ability to change and specialize?
The answer is that it's not only to slow down technical progress, but it can even turn it into the opposite way.
An example of this is Tasmania.
The T-shirts were isolated.
Back again to the image and ask ourselves, not only who did it and for who, but who knew how to do it?
Nobody, literally nobody.
"I'm actually reading the famous essay of Leonard Ridd, an economist in the 1950s, called ""I, Solvock," in which he wrote how an elephant is produced, and that nobody knows how to make an elephant, because people in the collection don't know how to get a graph. And they don't know how to wash trees and all that elephant."
What we've done in modern society, in ways of exchange and specialization, we've created the opportunity to do things that we don't even understand.
It's not the same thing in the language.
In fact, so I'm not interested in debate about intelligence level, or have some groups more high IQ than other groups.
It doesn't mean absolutely.
In society, it matters how well people transfer their ideas, and how well they cooperate, not how smart one person is.
We created a collective brain.
We're just nodes in the network.
We are the neurons of this brain.
Except ideas, meeting and mix ideas one of the one directional technical progress, gradually, step by step.
However, bad things happen.
In the future, as we move forward, terrible things will happen.
There are wars, depression, natural catalizes.
Strange things happen this century, I'm absolutely sure.
Thank you.
(Applause)
