(Arabic) I'm looking for a monastery from Satan in Alah, called Alah, a milestry and a milestry.
I was born in a middle class family.
That's why I was so disappointed.
My mother was born 16 children.
From 16 children, only five remained alive.
Imagine what my childhood was.
Every day, I saw women who were looking for funeral or children who went to visit the gallons.
I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children.
Unfortunately, in my country there was no internet for girls. So I was taken into the midst, but visiting it couldn't.
And my father sent me to America.
I moved to America.
I finished my education.
When I was studying, the Russian soldiers entered my country.
You know, when I graduated from university, I didn't even know what happened to my family and my country.
There were months, years, but I didn't know anything.
My family was in the refugee camp.
As soon as I finished my study, I moved my family to America.
I wanted them to live safe.
Where was my heart?
My heart was in Afghanistan.
I had a good job,
I studied at university.
And here I went to the refugee camp.
When I came to that camp in Pakistan, I saw 7.5 million refugees, and there were 7.5 million refugees.
About 90 percent of them were women and children. Most men were killed or killed. You know when I was in the refugee camp,
When I conducted a survey every day, I found things you and imagine you can't.
I saw a hurry with eight to eight children sitting and crying. She did not know what to do.
I saw a young woman who couldn't go anywhere, had no education, fun, which had no even a place for life.
It was a very abusive situation.
At that point, we talk about momentum.
At that moment, I asked myself, "What can I do for those people?"
How can I help them?
At that moment I realized that education changed my life.
She changed me, gave me a status.
At that moment I realized that I had to give my people education and health, and I started working on it.
Do you think I was easy?
No, because at that moment education was totally banned by the girls.
"It was hard to come and say, ""I want to do it." Who am I like?"
Did they trust me? Naturally, no.
That's why I had to set up trust in this community.
How was I going to do that?
I carried the interviews and I was looking, I was looking.
I asked.
He was 80 years old.
He was brave.
"And he looked at me, and he said, ""Wirry, a girl who's crazy. How can I become a teacher?"" And I said to him, ""I'm going to do a teacher with you."" Finally, he agreed. And when I started talking to him, the news began to spread."
Almost one year later, we had 25 schools, and 15,000 children who were going to these schools. It was a bad thing.
Naturally, we work, we encourage teachers. We teach women's rights, human rights, principles of democracy, justice. We're doing diverse training. One day, I'll tell you,
One day I was in the office in Beijing, Pakistan.
"So suddenly I saw my employees run to the room, shut the door and cry me, ""Wait, walk!"" If you are the leader you do?"
You're angry. You know it's dangerous.
You know that your life is on the corner.
But as a leader, you have to be courageous.
You have to marry and predict strength.
So I invited them to myself.
They came. Nine Taliban.
I invited them to sit and offered tea.
They refused, said they wouldn't drink tea.
Naturally, their tone, the voice they talked to me was very angry with me, and I really pulled out.
But I was strong, I kept courageous.
"They said, ""What are you doing?"
My employees started to go to the office.
They continued to open the clicks.
They worked with mother and children.
We've been training about women's health.
We've spent all the training you can only imagine.
I was happy. I was fascinated by the results of my work.
One day, four coaches, one gardener, and I went north of Columbus, and again, unexpectedly, we stopped the middle of the way of 19 young men.
With hunters on the shoulders, they turned us the way.
This time we are all killed."
We know where you were directed.
Everybody left home. Nobody remained.
I had only a gardener. I lost my voice.
There were hundreds of women coming to get education.
So here, I sat down and unexpected... at this moment, we talk about momentum... at this moment one of my wonderful donors called about the report.
"She said, ""Sakoña?"" I answered her."
Today, these people are my best coaches.
And — (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
It proves that education changes people.
I live in a country that was beautiful and good.
I just want to share with you.
We could go wherever we wanted.
Do you know what happened to my country?
Today, people can't go out of the house without paying attention to safety.
But we want to go back to our old Afghanistan.
They get diplomas and learn the feedback.
He said that compassion and love can be conquised by the universe.
Sirver-officitan: What do you want?
Client: GS, let's look.
Sirver: I'm sorry for a broken summary error that's covered with the best compressed data, two-coded bread, two-coded butterflies with operational, Kanficker-white chip, this pollination salts with a polymorphic pollination, and a copied whisk of code.
Client: I'm welcome to get a battery with operating memory and drink a bit of your best brush code.
Sirver: Is there anything on the salts?
We have tall high data radicals.
Client: Let's give you a puzzle, if you want to.
Sirver: It's the fastest price.
I will soon serve your order.
(Applause) My Pan: I'm drawing from your pair as I learned to keep a pencil in my hand, and I'm drawing a multiverse in native at age three.
And then I learned who are these animators.
On TV, they showed a program about careers that most children don't know.
"When I realized that animators were the ones that make the multiverse I would then look at the screen, I said exactly, ""I want to be an animator!"" I don't know if I heard it said, or myself, but it was a great decision moment of my life."
The exhibition of animations and art was always my favorite affairs.
"But the interest in computer technologies had created the idea of creating the animation ""The Green Walls."" ("Malizious Dishes," which is the beginning) There was a virus on my computer, I tried to miss it, and suddenly I thought, and what if there was my small world in the middle of the computer?"
Can there be any window where they meet to map together?
"So the gold pages were born."
When I was four years old, Dad showed me how to break the computer on parts and put it back again.
So I felt hard to computer technologies.
I built my first online window in a language of HTML, and now I learn JavaScript and Python.
"I also develop a new animation called ""Applause."" It's about bees and other detectors that are around, and why they're useful."
If the flowers weren't thrown out by these pollinators, then all the creatures which are dependent on plants, we would eventually die with hunger.
So I decided to use these file creations and make out of their superhero team.
(Applause) (Applause of legs) (Music) (Applause) Asking: Absolutely! Who else!
You need to call the rest of the Explorer!
(Music) Thank you. (Applause) All of my animations started with ideas, but what are ideas?
Ideas can inspire their hands.
Ideas are possibilities and new developments.
Because of ideas, the world is actually turning around.
If not ideas, we wouldn't be where we are now, there would be no technical or medical invention, there would be no art, culture, our lifestyle.
"When I was eight years old, I took my ideas and I opened the firm ""My Ideas,"" and alongside it the foundation ""My Ideas for the planet."
(Laughter) I'm making ecological clothes and oxytours.
I'm now 13, and despite what I started with the philosophy in 2008, my art development began much earlier.
A huge impact on me always answered art, and I wanted to help it to everything I do, including my firm.
By coming a piece of different fabric in the house, I thought I could make a glass or a chip from this — I had so many ideas of manufacturing the material!
"I noticed that when I dressed my products, I stopped on the street with a question, "How beautiful. Where can I buy this?""
I thought to myself that I could do a business and open a firm.
Because I was only eight years old, I didn't have any special business development plans.
I just knew I wanted to produce beautiful things that would not threaten the environment, and that I wanted to share with those who had less than I experienced in my life.
My mom taught me how to dress, and I sat on the entrance behind the house and made links on my head with ленes, and on the sheet I wrote the name and price for each of my products.
I started creating more products, like chips, chalk and bags.
My products started to buy around the world, and I had customers in Denmark, Italy, Australia, Canada and other countries.
And I realized, I had a lot of learning about dealing, like corporate name and distribution, how to support customer relations and observe what is sold better or worse.
The firm soon began to grow.
"And one day when I was 10 years old, I was connected with the Forbes magazine."
(Laughter) They wanted to write about me and my firm in their atlas.
Many people ask me why my products are ecological?
From a small age, I was deeply interested in the environment and the creation that I live in it.
My parents had early taught me to share with those who were less anxious, and with mind and passion to stand up to the environment.
I learned that paint for fabric or even processing would produce things that are dangerous for people and planets, and I started my research and learned that even after paint there was a problem for the environment in the fact that I knew what to do with the rest.
With the rest of the process of decoupling paint or with the rest, the most dry paint.
This contaminates the air, making it toxic for everyone and everyone who breathes them.
So when I started with the filter, I knew two things: all my products must be ecological, and that 10 to 10 percent of my salary must be sacrificed to local and global charity organizations.
(Applause) I think I'm part of a new wave of entrepreneurs who don't only want to earn money but hope for a sustainable development of the world.
I believe I can enjoy my buyers, and I'm just relying on the ability of future generations to live more eco-friendly lives.
We live in a big, diverse and beautiful world, and from that I have another card to protect it.
Put what happens in the world only by head and mind is not enough.
All we need to get through our heart, because it's then the idea of organizing our hands.
That's then the ability and invention to see the world, so ideas become reality.
Thank you, all peace and happiness.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Pat Mitchell: You've ever heard me talk about my parents who are behind this magic woman. Where are they?
Please Mr. and Mr. Pan, might you... wow.
(Applause)
Here's a couple of images of galaxies' combinations.
The name is perfectly matched with reality.
They numb these huge collections of galaxies that relate to reciprocity gravity.
Most of the steps you see on the screen are not the only stars, but the collection of stars, or galaxies.
Now, showing you some of these images, I hope you'll soon see that fusion of galaxies is not just beautiful objects, but more than that, I think the fusion of galaxies is mysterious, they wonder, and they're useful.
They're useful as the source of the most powerful laboratory universe.
And in your role as a laboratory, the signing of combinations means the signing of experiments you can carry over them.
I think there are four basic types, and the first type I want to report about is in the incubation of something very big.
Really, how big is it?
Okay, it's an image of one concrete combination of galaxies.
It's so massive that the light passing through it is coming out by saying because of the extreme gravity of this unit.
And if you really look very carefully, you'll be able to see the circles around the unit.
To avoid being vocal, it's that fusion of galaxies that has more than one million billion suns weight.
It's absolutely how massive these systems can be.
But more, they have a extra particularity.
They're basically isolated systems, and, if you want, we can think of them as about the smaller versions of the whole universe.
"And on many questions that can happen in us, about the global universe, like, ""How does gravity work?""
You can answer by studying these systems.
Yes, that's what we've said about an incredible number.
The second kind is that things are very hot.
Yes, if you take a picture of the combination of galaxies, and you remove all the light that is released by stars, then this big, blue steep will remain.
It's an uncertain color.
What we see here is actually Rentenz light.
And then the question is, if it's not the galaxies that vibrate this light?
And the answer will be hot gas, gas at a million degrees, it's actually already plasma.
And the cause of such a hot thing can be found on the preliminary slide.
The extreme gravity of these systems combinates the particles of gas and gives them a huge speed, and the huge speed, in its course, is a huge temper.
Here's this and there's a key sense, but it's just a scientific eclipse.
There are also many other peculiarities of this plasma, which as long as a head for us, still burns us, and still burns our understanding of physics of the excess-hearted bodies.
The third is learning very little.
To tell you about it, I need to tell you about the worrying fact.
Most of the mathematics of the universe are not made of atoms.
You've been manipulated yet.
Most is composed of something very mysterious that we call a dark matter.
Dark material is something that doesn't interact very well, except for the cost of gravity, and, of course, we're going to map to learn more about it.
If you're interested in physics particles, you're wondering what happens when we press something about each other.
And dark material is not an exception.
So how can we do that?
"If I answer this question, I'm going to answer a little different question, "What's going to be when galaxies together meet?""
Let's look at the image.
We remember that galaxies are like loses of the universe, just a slight version.
They preferably mix with dark mathery, and that's what you see in this blue burst.
Red is hot gas, and, of course, you can see a lot of galaxies.
What happens here is the accelerator of particles in a very, very large scale.
And it's very important, because it means that very, very little effects which are hard to get out in laboratory can join and join something we can see in nature.
Yes, it's very fun.
The reason why galaxies can teach us about what dark material is, the reason why galaxies can teach us about physics very little, exactly what they're so massive.
Number four: physics is very strange.
It's shown to actually communicate his head yet.
If there's something more strange, then it must be dark energy.
When I throw the ball into the air, I expect he to hunt the oven.
But I don't expect him to fly the oven at all larger and larger velocity.
So cosmologists explain why the universe is expanding.
They don't understand why it's expanding at all greater speed.
They give this reason to accelerate expansion of the name and call it dark energy.
And so we want to understand more about it.
And then, one special question, which is, how does dark energy influence the world in the most powerful scale?
And depending on her power, the structure can buy their risks faster or more slowly.
And the problem of the universe in a large scale is that it's terrible complex.
Let's look at the software simulation.
We need something to stop her.
I like to think about it using analogy.
To understand the Titan's kiss, the most important thing is not the model of the location of each small piece of a ship that has broken.
The most important thing is to see the two largest parts.
So I can learn a lot about the world in the greatest scale, looking after its greatest parts, and these parts are the fusion of galaxies.
Finally, I end my speech, but you can feel a little lurking.
I mean, what I started with how useful the combinations of galaxies, and I showed a few of these reasons, but how to actually use them?
Anyway, for the answer, I want to work with Henry Ford when he asked him about cars.
"All he said, ""If I ask people what they need, they would answer that they need faster horses"" The sun of our society meets a very large number of problems."
And the solution to these problems is not obvious.
They're not the faster horses.
They need an incredible number of scientific inventions.
Yes, we need to focus, so we need to focus, but we also need to remember innovation, invention, inspiration — these things come during how we extend our field of sight when we do a step back when we look from the distance.
And I think the best way to do this is to learn the world around us. Thank you.
(Applause)
"Yes, imagine you're at the street somewhere in America and here comes to you a Japanese and says, "Excuse what is this block called?""
"And you say, ""Excuse. Well, it's Owl Street, and it's Al Gore Street."
"It's twenty six, and it's twenty seven."" He says, ""Well. How is this block called?"" You answer, ""You know, there are no names in blocks."
"The soldiers have names; blocks are just the unimaginable spread between the streets."" He goes out, a little confused and disappointed."
"Everybody, and now imagine you standing on the street, somewhere in Japan, turn to the man near you and say, "Excuse what is this street called?""
"They say, ""Oh, here's Block 17, and this Block 16."" And you said, ""Well, what is the street called?"" And they say, ""How do you say, the street has no names."
There are names in blocks.
Here's a look at Google Maps. Here's Block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
There are names in all those blocks. Vulcases are just the unimaginable spread between blocks.
"And you said, ""Well, well, but how do you know your home address?"" And Ann says, ""Well, it's just: That's the eighth district."
"There's a block of 17, a house number one. You say, ""Finally. But playing the area, I noticed that the houses are not targeted according to the order."" And Эн says, ""It's okay. Number depends on when the houses were built."
The house which was built in the block first is the house number one.
The house which was built by the second is the house number two.
"The third house is the house number three. It's just. It's obvious."" Here, I really like that sometimes we need to get on the other side of the ground to understand something we didn't even appreciate and to understand that absolutely contrary things are possible."
So here's, for example, there are doctors in China who believe their job is to maintain your health.
So every month you're not sick, you pay them, and if you're not sick, you don't need to pay them because they haven't been able to deal with their job. They rich when you're healthy, not when you're sick.
"(Applause) Almost in any music, ""Ris"" is a length, the beginning of a musical phrase. Once, two, four."
"One in the North African music ""Now"" is the end of the phrase, after the end of the saying."
You can hear it not only in words, but also in how they count tactical music. two, three, four, once.
And this map is also correct.
(Laughter) Say that in every truth that we say about India, there's contrary, which is also true.
So let's not forget whether in TED or somewhere else, whatever close idea you have or you hear, her contrary can also be true.
Domo arigato gozaimashita.
