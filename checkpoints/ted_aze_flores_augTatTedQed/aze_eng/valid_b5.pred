I was 11 years old. At one of the morning, I remember as the index I played in our house's joy sounds.
My father was listening to the BBC News in a little crash radio.
There was a mutilation on the face that we never used to do at that time, because the news would face it otherwise.
"""It was taken back in Taliban!"" My father was crying."
I didn't understand what it meant, but I could see how happy my father was.
"Now, you can go to the real school," he said my father."
It was a morning I could never forget.
Going to the real school.
I was only six years old when the Taliban made an illegal school for girls who landed Afghanistan.
So for the next five years, I had to be dressed as a boy to go to the secret school by prosecuting my sister who was already forced to get out to the alone.
That's the only way we can't get both education.
Every day, we would go on a different way so that nobody would suspect where we go.
We would turn our books into the market bags, just saying that we're going to shop.
The school was inside a house, more than 100 people were packed in a little room.
It was comfortable in winter, but it would be terrible in the summer.
Teachers, students and parents — we knew that we all threatened our lives.
Sometimes, because the Taliban suspected, the school would be connected for a week of bizarre.
We were always scared of what we knew about our right.
You see, are they watching us?
Do they know where we live?
We were scared, but yet, school, was where we wanted to be.
I was actually very lucky because I grew up in a family that valued education and considers their daughters as a suitcase.
My father was a great person for his own time.
The owner of a different thought that lived in a narrow place of Afghanistan, the girl, so mother, was forced to go to school, and so even by his father, it was rescued from childhood.
But my mother who did education became a teacher.
It's cool.
Two years ago, he went out in the desert, and transformed our house into a school for girls and women in the neighborhood.
And my father — that's — was the first person who had learned in his family.
They didn't have any suspicion whether their daughters were going to be educating, but they were looking forward to the risks despite the Taliban threat.
So it was more dangerous that kids couldn't take education.
In the Taliban years, it came to mimic, it was time, it was our life, I was always tired of being in fear and not seeing a light from the future.
"I didn't face my hand of everything. And my father would say, ""Hey, my daughter, you can lose everything in your life."
The money can be black. You can put your house out in wars.
But the only thing that will stay forever with you is here, and if we have to sell our blood so to pay your school costs, we'll sell and send you to school.
"Now, are you tired of continuing?"" I am 22 today."
I grew up in a country that was destroyed in a war that continued for ten years.
I could only finish a middle school at less than six percent of my parents, and if my family didn't go so much after my education, I wouldn't even take it.
Instead, I'm standing here as a blend of a Middlebury Collider that's lost in your circle.
(Applause) When we came back to Afghanistan, one of the first people who congratulated me was my father who was driven because he sent her daughter to school.
He died not only because I'm outside, but also because I was the first woman who came to her in the street of Kabil.
(Applause) My family believes me.
I have big dreams, and my family's dreams for me are bigger.
So I'm a leader of a global campaign aimed at education to women called 10x10.
So I'm from the founder of SOLA, the first sleep school in Afghanistan, in a country where women are still risky to go to school.
And the most unexpected thing is that I see students who are able to benefit from opportunities in my school.
And I see how their parents, their fathers, my father did to me, despite all those who came up against me, are supportive of their daughters.
I can't tell you his face and his real name, but he's the father of one of my students.
About a month ago, when she went from SOLA to the villages with her daughter, she just pushed them a few minutes from dying in a bomb explosion outside the road.
When she arrived home, she landed the phones, and the voice on the phone would continue to send her, her daughter to school, it would spread up with the explosion to replicate.
"And he said, ""If you want, kill me now,"" he said, ""But I'm not going to protect my daughter's future because you're true and old ideas."" The fact that I've discovered about Afghanistan at the time, sometimes the fact that the Westers are expected — the value of a girl behind each of us that is knowing the value of the death and the survival of a father who is worthy of losing his success."
It doesn't mean that our mothers don't open our success.
In fact, parents are analogy that believe and lead their daughters to the bright future, but in a community like Afghanistan, the group of men is labging.
In the Taliban period, the number of girls going to school was measured by hundreds — as you know, it was said, the Korean.
Now, there's more than three million girls going to school in Afghanistan.
(Applause) Afghanistan looks very different when you look from America.
I understand what Americans see the uncertainty in change.
I'm afraid that it's not going to take too long after the U.S. army took these changes.
But when I went back to Afghanistan and saw the validity of children and support them in the school, I grew up my commitment to a bright future and a lasting change.
I think Afghanistan is a country of hope and unlimited opportunities, and girls who read in SOLA go to me again every day.
They also build big dreams like me.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
It's fascinating by all the means, in every wave.
It's lost in Azerbaijan.
It doesn't worry. Let's go back again.
One. Two. Three.
When I saw the first public murder event
It would make suspicion about anything,
I was so lucky, as I could escape, many North Koreans weren't so lucky.
When I learned a new language, after I got a job, all the lives could be underneathed at a moment.
We were all Korean, but without being broken down, after sharing,67 years.
Am I South Korean or North Korean?
So I started plans about how to save them.
Someone I didn't know
That's the symbol of my life at that time.
This is the child bond that we've designed in 2007.
We built it in the shape of the surface.
It can hit the period without standing on the roof of the building.
If you're a parent, you probably know that kids love a lot of cutting.
That's how the roof of the building looks like.
Why did we build it like this?
"The other director said to me, ""I don't want to be a sir.""
"And I said to him, ""It's not possible."" But he apologized, ""What's going to do if you go out of the roof?"
"You're going to fall on the kids."" (Laughter) I said to him, ""Not there."" Of course, the public workers said, ""Sure must be absolute.""
We applied that tory idea just around trees.
There are three trees inside the building.
They also allowed us to call these chairs surgery.
But it's completely used to another purpose.
They're collecting on top of the tower.
Kids are also gathered when they're drunk.
(Laughter) Sometimes, around a tree, we collect 40 children.
This guy likes the tree that you see in the Buddhas so much that she's eating it.
(Laughter) When any event is happening, they sit outside the roof.
It looks very beautiful from the bottom.
They're reading the Lap zoo to the monkeys.
(Laughter) It's time to eat.
(Laughter) (Applause) We've bought the roof as possible because we want to see children not only under the roof, but on top.
When the roof gets very high, it's only possible to see the ceiling.
And this is where you can eat a leg — every kind of water crane is there.
The green boros that you see are playing to swallow friends in children, and they can swallow, and this crane is normal.
But the boy you see is forced to take them with a crane, filling them with water.
(Laughter) The distance is completely open over the other time of the year.
There's no insect from inside and from the desert.
And that means the arxecture is basically made of the roof.
There's no surface between dragonflies.
There are no acoustic barriers too.
Most of the kids start to begin to begin to make sure when they're silent.
But there's no reason to originate in this connection.
Because there's no surface here.
The police officer says that if the boy standing on the corner doesn't want to be in the room, he can go out and go.
It's a pencil, where it's going to go back.
(Laughter) So I mean, I'm cooking, so kids usually like to hide.
And here they go and turn back.
And that's a natural process.
Secondly, we consider that it's very important to be sound.
You know kids sleep better at the voice.
They don't sleep at the heart.
In our connection, children show high concentration in class.
You know, our characters also grow the voice in the gravity.
They need a voice.
Also, you know you can easily talk to your friends on the place the voice.
You shouldn't have to be silent.
You know we're trying to control everything at the time.
And then it's completely open.
I mean, in winter, we can go to ride the wind at a temperature of 20 degrees,
And in the summer, we go to face.
We're solar in a pencil of 50 degrees.
We don't pass water.
We're married in the rain.
So we've been created to be in the sky.
We should also treat kids like this.
And here they're trying to share the synthesis.
They have to help their teachers in fact.
But they don't do.
(Laughter) And this kid gets in and is here.
So this is the sofa room.
And that's the hand-output.
They're talking good here.
Most rooms have trees.
It's trying to keep the tree on top of the bottom of the tree.
(Laughter) More honey. (Laughter)
In the roof of every class room, there's no window.
And Santa Claus comes from here in Milky.
And this is an extra structure, built along the right side of the circular bond.
It has a height of five meters, and it's seven floor.
The dog is so expensive.
We have to think about security.
For the experiment, we let a girl be a boy.
They're trying to get inside.
The piece is worth.
It's good, but it's robust.
He's powerful. He's my son.
(Laughter) Here he's looking at how safe it is to car it from the tree.
And then we left the other kids inside.
You know it's very faint in Tokyo.
(Laughter) It's trying to learn how the driver is going to drive in the front.
In the present time, kids need a little bit of danger.
In such cases, they learn to help each other.
It's a community, and we give these kinds of opportunities.
This chart shows the motion direction of a boy from 9.10 to 9.30 to 9.10.
The distance is 183 meters.
It's not so small.
So this little morning, it took six thousand meters across the road.
But the interesting thing is still ahead.
In this connection, children move 4,000 meters per day at average.
Children here have the highest athletic indicators between connections.
"The other minister always says, ""I don't train them. They're just like a bird speed."
"We're leaving my head."" (Laughter) They run for themselves. (Laughter)"
I think we don't have to control them and protect them from reality anymore, but they have to get rid of everything.
They have to take little care too.
Because we're going to teach them how to live in life.
I think heritage is able to change the world and the lives of people.
This building is also one of these steps taken to change children's lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In the 1970s, I worked with gymnastics for two years in China in Hunan.
When I was reading at first class, I received a suggestion that all the costs would be paid by the government to transfer to the athletic school.
"But my old mother said, ""No."" My parents also wanted me to be engineers like them."
It was the only way to make a good income and safe job as a result of the cultural revolution.
I don't like and don't love my work so important.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera artist.
That's how I draw my dream pianine.
I needed to engage with akrobatics from the age of young to be an Opera teacher, and I made me come from my hand to go to the Opera school.
I even wrote a letter to make a radio show to our high school teacher.
But the adults didn't like my mind.
Nobody believed I was serious.
But my friends supported me that they were also insecure children like me.
So when I was 15 years old, I realized it was late to train.
My dream was never real.
As the end of my life, I was scared that I would have the only happiness that I would get to the second class happiness.
But it was fairness.
I decided to find another way.
No one will show me the way? No.
I called books.
"I called this book written by a musician family to replace the advice of Valide, which was written by a musician family, and if I asked a confute tradition from a woman, I took the free woman model from this work, [" Jean Eyr."" I learned that I was able to be able to read from this book, ""The world is cheaper."" The real name: ""Cheaper by the Dozon"" This book was proud of me to read outside."
"[""What's the first book I read when I came to the U.S. in 1995, when I came to the United States?"
Of course, books that are prohibited in China.
""The Great Torpaq"" is about Chinese village life."
There's no advantage for the Propaq. I'm going to look like.
The Bible is interesting, a little bit strange.
(Laughter) It's the theme of another day.
"But my fiveth century brought me clarity. I mean, ""You're going to honor your father and mother.""
"I thought, ""Thank you."" And this is the way I got the chance to rebuild my relationship with my parents from the part of the guilty in the confutation."
And it gave me the opportunity to compare what I read with the new culture.
It can teach you a lot of things.
For example, this map looked strange to me at the first head, because in China we grow up by learning this map.
I never thought China wasn't supposed to be in the center of the world.
In fact, the map shows the world's view.
It's not a new thing with a great teacher.
It's a standard practice in the science world.
Even there are fields of science like comparative religion and comparative literature here.
Art and resistance helps scientists understand the whole issue.
I also thought, if you work for comparative scientific research, why don't you make it in everyday life?
So I started reading books in terms of cats.
"And let's say that people who were involved in the same event are about the friends who were part of the same passion, ""Benjamin Franklin"" writer: Walther Isaacson."" John Adams."
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) Or Christopher Moore) Or Joseph Campbell describes the same stories in different cultures as he did in his beautiful era.
For Jesus' prophet, these were economic, political and spiritual.
It's interesting for the future that these were all psychological: perseverance, fear and social perseverance.
If you know foreign language, it's also interesting to read books that you love in two languages.
"The writer, ""Chuang Tzu Way,"" Thomas Martinez, ""Tao: Waterhole"" wrote: Alan Wattts,"" I found other interesting facts, not the loss of my sense."
"Well, with the help of translation, I realized that happiness in Chinese means ""surface joy.""
"The word coming in Chinese is defined as ""my mother." Yes!"
(Laughter) Books play the magic portal that I can connect with people in the past and the Indian time.
I know I'll never be alone or insecure anymore.
It's nothing compared to the challenges of other people that your desire doesn't happen.
I started to believe that the only purpose of the dream is not to do.
The main purpose of the desire is to provide us to connect to the point where dreams, happiness and happiness are created.
The unreal desire is also capable of doing that.
Because books are because I'm here today and I'm happy. And I live very often with a clear purpose.
"I say to you, ""The books are always with you!""
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
You didn't stop it. Whatever you would do.
"The person would follow up until his own room, and you would ask, ""Why is my desk?"" Well, it's Friday night tomorrow, and you're in office. And one of you look at a meeting ceremony in your calendar."
And I speak about something that's much more valuable than the office furniture.
From time, from your time.
(Laughter) The key attribute of the Pressure Syndrome is to accept the invitation to meeting as you see in the calendar. (Laughter sounds)
"A brilliant reflex — bip, click, dict — is in your calendar, ""I'm going to go, I'm late to the meeting."" (Laughter sounds) Sounds are important, isn't it?"
Friendship is the open source of failure in every company.
And a meeting going in the way can really lead to a positive result.
We have to cry. (Laughter) That's why that's not that person can't take a good meeting, but that's the DRS, the Syndrome of Raising Without Thinking, which makes us create.
I actually have evidence that DRS is a global epidemic.
Let me talk to you.
A few years ago, I put a video on YouTube. I felt fascinated any kind of bad confrontation you could be in this video.
This video for about five minutes unifies everything we hate about bad meetings in itself.
A meeting surveillance officer who doesn't want to control the pattern, here
Participants who don't know why they are.
And everyone left the knife in a glimpse way.
It's a smiley case.
(Laughter) Let's look very quickly.
(Video) Now, our goal is to get compassion in a very important case.
Hello, Joe is. I'm working home today.
(Laughter) Hello Joe. Thank you for being arrested.
As a group — ding dong — (Laughter) Hello, who was involved?
No? Do you tell me that. (Laughter sounds) Do you know?
Yes, he's familiar with me too.
A few weeks after I put it on YouTube, 500,000 people from hundreds of countries, really from hundreds of countries, looked at this video.
And three years later, this video takes thousands of views every month.
Even babies who don't even see can't smile when they hear human voice.
"I'm Michael Shermer. I'm born a "Skeptic magazine," director of the Society of Skeptics.
We study judgments about paranormal events, psevdo-elm, interest groups and winds. These are science, psevdo-elm, non-elm, tullant science, wudu-elm, cube science, bad science and so forth.
If you're not living at Mars last time, then you're often confronted with things like that.
Some people call us a car in negative sense
But let's admit that car capture has a lot of things.
We're like a police government's explosion department, we find them and take them out. We're like Rallf Neydry of bad ideas. (Laughter) We want to change bad ideas with good ideas.
I'm going to show you an example of a bad mind.
I brought it with myself. It gave us this for a research to the N.N. Dateline.
"Quadro is producing the company in North Virginia."
"The name is ""Quadro 2000 Explorerbox.""
(Laughter) They sold it to school leaders for $99.
It's a plastic thing that's placed on top of the Radio Shack antenne.
It can be used to search for a lot of things from the reader devices. But it's worth looking for marijuana in the cafeteria of the student.
(Laughter) So it works like this: If you go back to the box when you're sitting in the cortisol, you open the coffee.
That's something like that.
I'll show you.
(Laughter) Hmm. It's a little fruit of turning back to right.
We're going to try it again because we're scientifically doing it.
We're sure it's going to go on this side.
(Laughter) Mr. Excuse your cows. (Laughter)
Of course, the key question is: can this tool find marijuana in the cockroach?
And the answer is, yes, if you open the coffee enough, you can find it.
(Laughter) (Applause) We have to follow not only what we find in science, but also what we don't find.
And the opening point of my short talk here is probably that it's like: Exclusters, astrologists and the outskirts always use it.
They remember what people find, they forget they don't find.
We record everything in science. We compare the number of random and objective found.
That's what we did here.
We took two boxes, one of them into a marijuana with official registration of CG, and one of them were put empty.
And about 50 percent of the tests have been successful. (Laughter) We're also getting this result when the cockroach father.
It was an interesting, small example about what we did.
The "Skeptic" magazine is published for three months. Every newspaper has a subject."
This is about the future of the weak publication.
Are people intelligent or not when they go?
I have a certain idea about this, and I'm going forward to me, and I'm seeing it is that when people go, they're smart.
Every ten years, the average IQ is increasing 3 numbers.
It's very interesting.
Don't think of skepticism or science as something material.
Are they in harmony with science and religion?
It's like asking science about the harmony of the sanatorial cockroach.
These are two different things.
Science is not an education, it's an activity.
It's hard to think about generations.
It's the way to discover natural explanations for all the phenomenons.
"What do you think it's more true? Is there a way away from the other galaxies of the Earth's species or multi-dimensional creatures, making Bob's coffee field in Canada for the commercial sceptic.com?"
Or does one of the skeptical readers make it with the Photoshop?
Anyway, the key question (Laughter) is what definition is that it's more realistic.
Before we say something is relevant to another world, we should be sure it's not from this world.
"How can it be more realistic? How can Arnold help alienists to be a cabaretist? Or does the World Week News invent this?"
(Laughter) So things like this found the opposite in the cartoon of Sydney Harry.
"For those who are in the background, I read, ""That's a miracle next."
"I want you to explain the second step better."" This slide destroys all the intelligent design arguments."
That's what this cartoon does.
(Applause) You can say to Prime Minister. But it doesn't explain anything. It doesn't put a medium idea.
There's nothing to get rid.
For the Creators of intelligent design, it's the end of the controversy.
Because the East is paid, scientists sometimes call invisible things as dark energy, dark matter. Until they understand what it is, they say it's called it.
It's the beginning of the mind window for science.
And it's the last corner of the window for the intelligent design services.
The same question comes again. What's more realistic?
Are the U.N. the cars of alien beings, or the wreck of gravity or the explosion?
This is a picture of a U.N. picture taken from my home in Altadena to Pasaden from California.
This is the cockroach, is it? Because it's such a cockroach.
"Nobody ""Photoshop," high technology, computer doesn't need."
"I've taken this picture with the code instamatic device."
Someone left the cockroach ready in his hand.
The camera was also ready — so much.
(Laughter) You can think some of them are real, although they're holding a lot of them or illusion. But the big possibility is that they're all missing.
If we take more general, we're always looking for a line between evidence and theory in science.
For example, there were two problems when the Hubble's telescope directed to Saturn.
First, there was no theory about planetary galaxies.
Secondly, let's hold the evidence and it was dark. So she couldn't immediately understand what she saw.
"He wrote his eyes like this: "I noticed that the planet in the remote is made of three bodies.""
He decided it was what he saw.
So, without good planetary rock theory, you can't form good theory with unreal data.
That's what happened until 1655.
It's a page of the book that Christian Huygens came out of the instructions that people used to understand Saturn.
These two things were known to Huygens. There was a good theory in the hand of planetary galaxies and solar systems. And there was more precise telescope data available. So according to Kepler's laws, we realized that Earth explode faster than Saturn.
And with this telescope, we could see the angles of the galaxy.
And that proves the theory.
The bad side of the theory is that it can be full of scientific progress.
One of the reasons why people believe in the bizarre is that we only have and understand what we have. Then I'm going to touch serious reasons.
We were eager to see face everywhere.
This is the wind in Mars.
In 1976, NASA wanted to take other pictures of the same place, and people thought that it was in the abyss that was created by marks.
Here's a picture taken close in 2001,
If you cut your eye, you can split your face again.
When you're short your eyes, you're turning the precise image into a more unreal image. So you're reduced the quality of information.
And if I didn't say where you should look, you would see the face because we were adapted to evolve and recognize their faces.
Face is important for us from social viewpoint.
And of course, smiling faces. It's easy to see any kind of face.
Here you see a smile face in Mars.
(Laughter) If astronomers were building, they would also see the Koran Kermiti.
Look. Have you seen the minds of a little building?
Or if the geologists were flies...
The religious icons.
(Laughter) In 1996, he found a pencil in Tennessee.
He bought five dollars from those who wanted to see the rapper's wreck. That's probably until Rahib received a warning from the village of Tereza.
Here's Bakra Guadalupe and Watsonville, down on the street. Or was it the street upstairs?
The tree tree tree is pretty good for this work, because there are patterns of colored, armed, white flowers, and as you see these pictures on it — humans are animals that draw a picture.
This is the Miracle Mary outside the window in San Paul.
Here, Bakery Mary showed her face in a peninsula, and I could hit it in a cassino in Los Angeles. Yes, the axis is here in America.
(Laughter) The Cassino paid 28 500 dollars to buy this sendman from the eBay. (Laughter)
So what do you think he's reading now? Look at Mary? (Laughter)
The cows were bleeding, the position that was underneath 1940s.
I'm going to see clearwater in Florida.
I went to myself to see it too.
There were a lot of people.
There's a lot of faithful people who came with real Arabs, with golf trees.
We were also closer interested.
Because you know the size — we've been standing on the front of this image of David, I and the great Randi, which is two, two and a half floor.
In the sense of honesty, thousands of chores blew up.
We went and looked back to the side to understand what was happening.
You don't say, there's such a picture in places with fontan and palm tree.
And this is the picture of the Miracle Miracle on the other side. They started to look at it.
However, most of a building can be a miracle.
(Laughter) Is this really a miracle of Mary now, or is the Marge miracle? (Laughter)
I'm going to take another example about it, and end my talk. With seasonal illusions.
There's a movie called ""Great Voice," playing Michael Kiton, telling the deaths talking to us."
When it comes to the ground, talking to the dead is actually not worth such a huge difference.
It seems that everybody can speak.
It's the answer to the deaths that are hard.
(Laughter) In this movie, guya has hidden these messages in electronic events.
I upload them from a website called Reverse Speech.com.
This is the most famous.
This is the ordinary sound of that famous song.
(Laughter) If you're older, don't worry.
May Kenyan is clean in the summer.
It's time to change the way, though two ways are separate.
Now, let's sound the translation. Look at the word here, can you hear the hidden message?
(Music and incomprehensible words) [Satan] - The devil
(Music and incomprehensible words) What did you hear? Recording: The devil!
The devil? You can't hear the lessest devil.
Now, I'm going to say what you should hear to the listening part of your brain and hear again.
I'm going to end with a little, beautiful and meaningful story.
""Skeptics"" is an extraordinary non-profit organization."
Now we're looking for good things that people do.
There's also a pop singer in England.
Now it's very popular in England: it's called Kate Malé.
There's a very beautiful song.
"It was between the best five songs in 2005, which is called ""double million bicycles in Beijing."" It's a love story — it's considered Norah Jones in Britain. The boy that he loved is also the right he loved very much than twenty million bicycles."
There's a part like this in words.
(Music) We're 12 billion light years away from the horizon. It's a galaxy. Nobody can say that it's true. But I can say I'll be with you for the lifetime.
Spiker: All right. At least it's the nearest number.
"It would be in America, ""We're six thousand light years away from the sky."" (Laughter) My friend Simon Singh is a gravitational physicist. It's now a scientific scientist, and it's the author of the book ""Big Bang."" That's worth all the opportunity to promote good science."
"So, in ""The Guardian," he wrote an article about the song of Cassie, and he said there we know exactly how far we are from the border."
We're not 12 years away, 13,7 billion light years away, and that's not a trust.
We know exactly how much it's, though it's a little probability.
So, if it's not exactly right, we can say it's very close to the right number.
The wonderful thing is that after the publication of his writing, Kate called him. And I said I was very embarrassed, I was a member of the astronomical club.
I didn't have to keep the way. He also wrote the song.
I'm going to end my talk about it too.
(Music words) We were 13,7 billion light years away from the border of the universe where we could be a witness.
It might be a real advantage pay, but it's the nearest detailed number.
And by referring to the data in our hand, I predict so that I'll always be with you.
(Laughter) Well, don't you think?
(Applause)
In the 1980s, if you had a written machine in communist East Germany, you had to register it.
The example of a text written in the machine had to register.
So the government knew the source of all the texts.
When they found a paper that inspired a moral mind, they could find the author of this mind.
And we were considering something like this in the West as a huge threat to freedom of expression.
We couldn't let it ever in our own countries.
But today, in 2011, if you print something to take a laser print device of any famous marker, it will automatically print the yellow points of the bottom that are just belonging to your printer, and the printer will distinguish from others.
It's the reality of our today.
Nobody's going to put it in prison.
This is an example of what our government uses technology against us — against its citizens.
This problem is one of the three key online problems.
And when we look at the problems online, we see the attacks on the Internet that are happening by certain groups.
These attackers are divided into three main groups.
First, they're criminals online.
In this way, like Dmitry Golubov, who is from Kiev in Ukraine.
And it's not too hard to understand why criminals lose crime online.
These guys get money.
Many, they're actually doing online attacks to get a lot of money already.
In fact, we've seen people with millions, multimillioners with online attacks.
This is Vladimir Tsasts from Tartu in Estonia.
This is Alfred Gonzalez.
And this is Stephen Watt.
This is Bjorn Sundin.
This is Matthew Anderson and Alexis Al- Daour.. It's also possible to extend the black.
These guys get their services online, but they do it in illegal ways, when we operate online, they use things like banking viruses to steal money from our banking accounts, or when we shop online from a virus, they collect our credit card information with key reader programs.
Two months ago, the U.S. secret service organization broke the account of the Swiss bank of the person named Sam Jain in this picture, which was 14,9 million US dollars when it was dissolved.
And nobody knows where Sam Je's.
I think today, the possibility of being a crime victim on the Internet is greater than the real world.
And it seems clearly that when the situation goes, it's getting worse.
In the future, the big frame of crimes will happen online.
The second big group of online attacks are not the reason it attracts money.
The reasons why they want to see this work can be opposition, freedom of mind, smile.
Groups like Anonymous have grown over the last year and started to hold the main place in the attacks online.
I counted two of the three main attackers: those criminals who do this for money, such as Anonymous to protest, and the third main force, the government and the governments.
Let's look at what happens in companies like DigiNotar.
It's a baric example of what governments are when attacking their citizens.
DigiNotar is a Certificate Discovery in Netherlands — more true — it was.
In the last year, they've been infected of their online cells.
Someone went into the systems and the whole system was crushed.
And in a refugee last week, I asked the Dutch government officials about this question, and I asked one of the government representatives that I didn't believe that DigiNotar was causing human death.
He said he believed.
How do people die by such an attack?
DigiNotar is the Online Certificate Organization.
They sell a certificate online.
What do they do with certificates?
If you have a website based on the Internet, and if you want to use a Secure Secure Service, as well as in Gma, you need this certificate.
We use most of us from the Gmail or the reader services, but services like this are more popular in countries that have the total regime like Iran. In these countries, the opposition use more than the external services like the Gmail, because they can't control local government emails than they've been involved as a password as a SSL.
But this surveillance, the external certification that offers such services
It's possible by breaking the website of companies.
And that was what happened to the DigiNotar company.
What about the Arab Bahrain and, for example, what's happening in Egypt?
In Egypt, in April 2011, the prisoner ran off the center of the Egyptian secret police, and when he searched for him, they would take a lot of documentary steps.
"In these papers, there was a benefit called ""FINFISHER."" And in this file, there were records of a meaningful company in Germany. The company sold instruments and programs to the Egyptian government to control all the communication tools of citizens in general."
These tools were sold to the Egyptian government to 280,000 euros.
The center of the company is exactly here.
Shortly, the Western governments provide the devices that allow the total governments to control their citizens under control.
But the Western governments do it also to their own citizens.
For example, a few weeks ago in Germany, there was a virus called the State Virus, which was created three to investigate their citizens by the German government.
If you're punished by any string, it's obvious that your phone is listened to everybody.
Now, it's already about it.
They're going to follow your Internet connection.
By moving the State virus to your computer, can control all your relationships, listen to your online discussions, learn your passwords.
"When we talk about things like this, many people are very likely to say, ""Really, it's not a good job, but I'm a citizen who respects the law, it doesn't have a lot of impact on me."
Why should I be worried about it?
"I don't have anything crazy."" But that's a very stupid idea."
Privacy is a condition.
It's not about music.
It doesn't matter the choice between security and corruption.
It's about the choice between freedom and control.
And this is our way to believe in our government today of 2011, and if we reject any rights.
But can we also believe our eye-linked government in the future, like the next 50 years?
And questions like this must have things that will worry us in the next 50 years.
(Music) (Applause) Thank you for being here
"And I say, ""Thank you for being here,"" because I was in a box for 17 years."
(Laughter) And I said that I was the 20th anniversary of the Earth Day in Washington DC.
My family and friends fell up here to listen to me and
"I said, ""I'm compassionate because you're here," and my mother screwed out of the audience, and said, ""Haluya, Johnny speaks.""
(Laughter) Imagine what you're staying in a desert for 17 years, and imagine your mother's kind of life behavior.
"My father said to me, ""That's the only one."" I'll understand it."
I looked around because I couldn't understand where my voice came from
"I didn't hear my voice for 17 years, looking around me, I said, "God, who is who sounds what I think?""
And then I realized that this is my self and my smile
"My father said, ""Yes, he's also a pencil."" Now I want to take you into this journey."
Despite the extraordinaryness of this journey, this is all of us.
I believe that it might be metaphor for our journey, and I also want you to think about your journey.
My journey started since 1971, when I was witnessing the collision of two oil tankers under the Golden Gate, then a half million gallons of oil disappear.
It affected me so much that I decided to not use engine transport tools.
It's a big thing for California
This was also a big thing for the iceberg of the little Point Reyes station I lived in Inverness, where 350 people lived there in the winter of 71-year.
And when I came here, I started walking on the cat, people — they knew what was happening.
"They asked me, ""John, what are you doing?"" I also said, ""I'm walking in a cat for a terrible environment," they said, ""No, you do it to shame us, right?""
"You're doing it to bring you bad yet," maybe they were right, I thought when I went on the cat, people would join me."
Because it's because it's all about oil that's broken on the ocean.
He spoke, and I was arguing with people about this, without stop.
I call my parents
"And I said, ""I don't use cars anymore."" My father said, "" didn't you do it when I was 16 years old?"" (Laughter) I didn't know about the environment at that time."
They lived in Philadelphia
"I said to my mother, ""I'm very happy for everything," he said, ""If you're excited, you don't need to tell it anything."" Mom's like this."
So, at my 27th birthday, I decided that — since I had a lot of arguments and I talked a lot — I decided that I stopped talking but I would do a single day, a day-day phase.
So I did that —
I didn't even speak a pencil when I was standing up tomorrow.
And I'm saying that it became a nice experience for me because for the first time I started listening to that long time
And what I heard made me feel.
Because I always thought I was listening to people, and when I was listening to people, I thought that when I was listening to people, I didn't listen to them anymore.
And when I was talking to people, I went forward to them, and I thought about what I would say when they were talking.
And then...
So the communication ended up
And that day I really listened to
And that was a question for me because I realized that I was learning something in these years.
I was 27 years old, and I thought I knew everything.
But I didn't know.
So I examined it for the next day, and then again and this time already constantly. I promised myself that I would be in a desert for a year because I already started studying, and I needed it.
So I didn't talk for a year, and at that time, at my name day, I thought I would start to talk again, maybe from what I learned some things
But it took this speed 17 years.
I came to the cat for 17 years, and I played on the bank, and I also worked on writing my art and my day. I tried to study the entire engineering book with reading
And I thought I needed to get education.
I went to ashland, Oregon, they had education programs around there.
800 kilometers away
I went to the award office and... what? ... What?
I showed the message in the newspaper.
Ah, do you want to read here when you're born?
Talk...?
We have a special software for you. They did it
And after two years, I ended up with a degree of success.
My father came. He was proud of me
"And he said, ""Hey, my son, we're proud of you, but we don't know what to do with this bachelor degree."
"You're not driving the car, you're not talking, you've got to do it."" (Laughter) I took my flower and took that suitcase and I started walking again."
I came to Port town, Washington, and I made it back here from the tree, running it across the Puget sound, from Idaho to Washington, and from there to Missoula, to Montana.
Two years ago, I called the University of Montana, and I loved this.
Two years would not be bad to stay here
(Laughter) And that's what happened. I've been studying at university for two years. The village showed me a lot of help.
There are two stories about Montana.
The first thing is that when I arrived here, my money was broken
"And they said, ""Don't worry about it,"" The director of the program said, ""Come back tomorrow."" He gave me 150 dollars and said, ""Go through registration for a lesson."
"You go to South America, hell?"" I said to him — The river and the stars, the hydrogen systems, South America."
So I did that.
"He went back and said to me, ""Ok, John, taking the opening of the office taking the letter for a lesson and using the library as a student."
And we're also allowed you to participate in their class from all professors,
"Let's be easy to get the piece and solve the rest of the amount, and you can register from the class and then get the grade."" Yes! It's usually not done such tests in the magistrate."
They wanted to help me was big, and I
They saw that there was a lot of my life in the environment, and they tried to help me in this way.
In this period, I also took classes without talking.
When I first went into the classroom, I had 13 students.
He translated my friend, who understood them with hand signals, my friend: the name is John Francis, I walk in the cat... I told them that it won't be translated anymore — that's the last lesson.
All of the students around are...
(Laughter) So I saw the deadlines of time to get out quickly.
But I had to say that fan to them.
Two weeks later, everyone tried to get into our classroom.
I learned a lot in this class — when I did these kinds of movements...
He all turned his head to say what John works to say — I don't know, I think he understood the cut of the tree. Yes, the cut of the tree
No, no. It's not that — it's the use of this handbag.
You cut the hand with the mouse...
You can cut in the background...
No, he speaks about the selection mechanism
So this was a symptous discussion, and we were discussing
I was taken back from this job and say I've gone away.
But there was something I learned. Sometimes when I showed a sign, they sounded the sense that I didn't really predict, but I had to predict it.
And I thought, if you're a teacher and you're educating, and if you don't learn yourself, you don't have to teach well.
So I continued.
"My father came to the release ceremony in my head and my father said, ""We're proud of you, but ..."" You know the result, he said, ""You have to start driving and talk to the car."
"What do you think to do with the Magister degree?"" I took my Chinese, threw my suitcase out and went to the University of Wisconsin."
And I went there for two years, writing about oil scum.
Nobody was interested in oil scum.
But something happened — Exxon Valdez.
And I was the only man who wrote about oil scum in the U.S.
My father came again
"He said, ""I can't understand how these things do, ""You don't use the machine, you don't talk."
"My father said, ""You need to leave you out, because you look better things you're putting down."" (Laughter) I got my suitcase back."
I took my bathroom and went to the East coast, and I put my feet into the Atlantic Ocean, and I took seven years and one day to go to the United States from this head to go alone.
And in 1990, I started to land on the 20th anniversary of the Earth Day.
So I worked with those dragonflies because when trees fall down in the forest, there's no one man who heard that, then that's not the voice.
And I thanked the soldiers and my family because they came to hear me
And that's the connection.
And they taught me about listening — they heard me
And that was something that didn't come from that box — listening to each other.
It's really very important — we need to listen to each other.
My journey continued.
"My father said, ""It's the only one."" And I didn't yet let it do it."
I've worked as a Saharan Guard, and I've been the U.N. Embassy.
I wrote the rules for the U.S. — the rules for oil scum
"20 years ago, if someone told me, "John, do you want to make a difference from the birth?""
""Yes, I want to make difference.""
"They would say, ""Come up to my right place, fall out of the car and start to my right place."" And then they would say, ""Well, let's cook it."" (Laughter) My friend, you want to make a difference.""
How does that happen? How?
How can we distinguish with simple things like walking and not talking on the market?
The Saharan War was a beautiful time.
"And after that — I worked here just a year — I said, ""Well, it's enough one year to do this."" I took a long return and went to the Caraib Gulf until I went to Venice, all the eyebuses in the army."
The key thing came out — I've got to tell you why I started talking to you
I started talking, I learned the circular engineering
I learned the environment engine at this level — formal level, but there was also an unformal surface.
And non-formal wisdom — that was what I learned about people, what we do, and we are curiosity.
And the environment is not only because of trees and birds, but not for the species that are in danger, but for our interactions with each other.
And if we look at the environment now, we're all around us and see our behavior against ourselves and each other
And that was the insect that I wanted to transmit.
"And I said, ""I've got to transmit this inventor to other people," and I sat down and sat over the loop of the career — that was my own source, and I worked on it — I came to Venice and I started walking."
This is the end of the story, and I realized that I wasn't going to come there because I still didn't use the car
I went across El Dorado — here's a famous prison city or a peninsula prison — in Venice, and I don't know what happened to me because I wasn't in myself
"And when he went through the protective field, the boxman held me and said, ""Pasaaporte, pasaporte"" and I pushed M16 on my face."
"I looked at her and I said, ""passport?"
I don't have to show you a pass, she's in my suitcase.
I'm going to Sri Lanka — PhD Francis and I'm going to tour the world and leave the rate.
What caused me to say that?
The road turned to the prison.
They didn't hate me.
I was free, and thanked God because I was free? What do I say?
When I went 150 kilometers on the road, I realized that I was transformed into my heart, including space,
I was in prison and I had to run out there.
I didn't use military transport tools was the prison I was inside.
What's going to happen?
Because when I started, it looked like it was appropriate to use my car.
But the difference was that I wanted to look out of myself every day, but I never wanted my decision to use my feet.
That's how the U.N. thought I would be to Syria,
It didn't come to my mind to be a professor.
And so I realized that I had other responsibilities except my secret self, and so I had to change.
You know, we can do that.
I had to change
And I was scared of changing because I was always learning to go and be bored.
Because I learned to a prison who didn't want his last.
I didn't know who I would be when I was walking.
But I knew that was necessary.
I knew I had to change. Because this was the only way to be here today.
And I know, very often, we find ourselves somewhere we always want to stay, but there are other places to go for us.
And we have to go back to where we have the stability of our identity that we have now, and we have to go to where we have new identity.
And I want to thank you for not going to that next place — take you out of the prison you see inside of yourself to where you can come out to that place that's as comfortable as it can be. Today, we have to do things on this way.
We have to change now.
As our previous Vice President said, we should be happy.
And if my voice affects you, if my lives affect you, if my voice affects you if I'm here, please do that.
I know that when I'm here, you can all affect me.
Let's go to the beach — let's go out to the world, take this source, this love, this respect with us — here's the relationship we show each other at TED by becoming the world with us,
Because we are environment engineers and our mutual behavior means our behavior that is our environment.
So because you're here, I'm grateful for you, and I want to end my output here with a five-second cycle.
Thank you
(Applause)
"I think you stand on any street in America and a Japanese comes up to you and asks, "Look, what's the name of this block?""
"And you say, ""That's the Oak street, and it's the Science street."
"It's 26th, it's 27th."" He says, ""Well, what's the name of this block?"" You say, ""Not the name of the block."
"They have the names of dragonflies, blocks are just the non-called communities between the streets,"" He's looking for you, while you're a little sad and embarrassed."
"Now let's imagine if you stand on any street in Japan and you turned to the island around me, "Look, what's the name of this street?""
"He says, ""This block is 17 and the number of that block is 16"" And you say, ""What's the name of the street right?"" He says, ""No names of the boxes."
The blocks have names.
Look at Google Maps. Here are 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 blocks.
They all have names of these blocks. The Küste are the unknown institutions that are between blocks.
"And you say, ""Well, how do you define your home address?"" He says, ""It's very easy. It's the eighth ray."
"And this is the block 17 and the house number 1," you ask again, ""OK. When I went around, I noticed it that ""I didn't go home addresses with a number," he says, ""Of course, they're going. They're fundamentally rotating the history."
The number of the first house built in the block is one.
After that, the number of two of the built is two.
"It's crazy. It's easy and intelligent."" Sometimes I love it most that we have to go to the one side of the world to see that the opposite can be so right to understand what we never thought."
For example, doctors in China think that their job is to keep you healthy.
In the months you're grateful, you pay money to the doctors, and if you're sick, you don't pay any money, because they didn't come from the destruction of their own work. They're getting when you're healthy, because you're sick.
"In many music, we consider the gesture of starting to a single, two, three."
"But in the Western Africa music, Amy shows the end of the musical part, like the point at the end of a sentence."
So, you see it not just when you split it into parts, but when you count it. Two, three, four, one.
And this map is also true.
Smiling I'm saying that whatever you know about India is the way it's true.
So, let's never forget, whether you have a great idea at TED or elsewhere, or you hear, the way that can also be true.
Domo arigato gozaimashita. (Thank you. Japan)
