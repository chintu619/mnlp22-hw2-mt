I'm going to talk about unexpected discovery today.
I'm now working in solar technology industry.
And my little beginning point is to bring ourselves into force, and it's also...
... look at different sources for that.
It's just a little video about what we're doing.
Oh... a minute.
The rise can happen a little bit of time.
(Laughter) We're just going to pass this part — I'll just pass over the part of the video... (Laughter)
No. (Laughter) (Laughter)
(Music) That's not... (Laughter)
Well. (Laughter)
Solar technology...
Oh, was my time finished?
Well. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So I want you to focus on what you're doing.
We're going to come back to it after a few minutes. I hope if you learn to control your body slightly, it can significantly change your life.
We are very interested in body language, especially taking our attention to body language of others.
The different points are interested in us: (Laughter) something simple like any walking or smile, an unbelievable view or worrying expectancy, or even blinking the hand.
East: Here they're going to come to a 10-year house.
This lucky policeman pulls the hand of the President of the U.S.
We wear. We collect ourselves.
We're screwed.
We're trying to be invisible for the person around us.
As you see, animals and humans do the same things again.
When we face the strong and the weak, it's manifesting this image.
When we've come back to the desert, we're usually prepared to complete the gestures of others.
So if someone uses power against us, we're trying to collect. We don't replicate his gestures,
Instead, we're going to follow his power.
I saw that the MSB students show a lot of power stones.
Some of them take themselves as a leader, when they go into the class room, they go right in the middle of the octopus, they place themselves since they don't start teaching yet.
When they're staying, they're holding the place of almost two people.
They raise their hands in this way.
I made some results for myself.
One is probably not going to surprise you.
It's considered to be about crime.
So women depend on this blood rather than men.
Women usually feel vulnerable themselves than men, and it's not surprising.
And it's very important for the students of the MA, because it affects the prices of education.
Business schools are always fighting gender gap.
Men and women who are made at the same level get different prices at the end of the course, and it seems to be related to the involvement of it.
I started thinking about myself, let's see that the sign that they come in this way is more active in the lesson,
So if they show these videos, if they want themselves to take these kinds of apples, are they going to participate more active in the lesson?
So if we show ourselves strong for a short time, can we feel stronger as a result of our behavior change?
Now we know that our gestures and mimics define thinking and parts of others about us, and there's a lot of evidence of that.
But the question that really cares for us is that these gestures and mimics don't affect ourselves.
So it's true both of all.
It's also about power.
When we feel strong and confident, we're fruit of gestures that show more power, but when we try to be strong, we feel strong.
What do I say when I think about power, what do I say when I think?
I talk about thinking and feelings, also about physiological things that form them, and for me, these are hormones. I study hormones.
What's what distinguishes the minds of the weak with the strengths?
And only 60 percent of those in the power position. That's a pretty important difference.
And that's what we found in testosterone.
As soon as they went, I grew up with 20 percent in testosterone that passed through the experience of power, and in others, 10 percent in total.
They're going to do these changes for two minutes.
And what happens in cortisol is this:
It's about 25 percent in cortisol of those in the power position, and in others, it's about 15 percent in the size.
It takes about two minutes to make these harmonical changes, which make our brains feel more assertive, safe and comfortable, or stressed and door.
These particles are familiar with us all, huh?
So our body language defines how to think and feel about ourselves, so nonverbals are not only for others.
And our other bodies change our mind too.
And the next question that cares for us is the question that we can significantly change our life when we take a few minutes of power position.
This is a two-minute experiment that happened in the laboratory.
So where can we apply it in real life?
Of course, that's what makes us really interested.
In fact, these poses can be used to be measured when situations that make a social threat.
Where are we usually valued?
This is the back of the dining desk for the newborns.
For some of them, it's school meetings.
It's a call for some people or a talk in this way, or a job interview.
We thought many of you were interested in the product interview because most of you had such an experience.
So we published our findings, media debated them across, and what jusrillists said, "Do we do this when we go to a job interview?"
(Laughter) Of course we rejected this idea. No! Of course no! We didn't even predict it.
You don't do this is meaning!
It's not with your other people,
It's the three things you communicate with yourself.
What do you do before you start an interview? Usually
You're sitting. You look at your iPhone or Android.
You look at your notes, get rid, collect yourself. And in fact, what you have to do is probably that's this. As you sit on the foot. Sit it for two minutes like that.
That was what we wanted to hate.
The explorers went to the lab, went through a very intense job interview after they received re-power and powerless poses.
The interview for five minutes was taken into a video.
They were taught them to use a nonverbally tool to prevent the effects of those who measured the audience. They looked like this.
In five minutes, looking at an emotionally inaccessible face is much easier than asking a question.
Nobody loves it.
Marianne La France calls it "Stop in the social battle," which increases the level of cortisol in this person.
We took them through such a interview to see the results.
Then we showed code four of these pictures.
They were unprecedented from the east, from our expectations.
When they looked at video shows, they showed people who had a high-power position saying, "We want to take them."
"We don't want to take them to work.
"And the early ones are more positive."" What's something that affects it?"
It's not because of their speech.
It's about what they're putting in their notes.
We looked at the other indicators of them, for example, how much are the dictionary glossy?
What benefits do you have?
There was no difference between these indicators.
What showed the main effect was not that.
People just showed their real faces.
So they did show themselves.
You don't imagine their thoughts, they showed themselves.
It ultimately affects this factor.
"And when I say to people, our bodies can change our minds, our behavior, and our behavior can change our outcomes, say, ""Is it not a little preservation?"" And I."
I'm saying to simulate until you get to reality.
"""I'm not like that."
I don't want to make something real and feel awkward.
I don't want to be a lawyer.
"I don't want to be where I'm not alive.""
"I understand these words very well. I want to tell you a little story about the feeling of being silent and ""I'm not my place.""
When I was 19, I suffered a very severe car accident.
He was caught in a desert from a car.
I turned out there several times.
I played in the rehabilitation department, I had to leave college, and I kept the news that my IQ level fell down at a level of two indicators, which was very painful for me.
I was born to IQ because I was known as a kid who was intelligent and aspirated from childhood.
Because I was released from college, I tried to go back.
They said to me, "You won't finish college.
There's a lot of things you can eat, but college industry isn't," they said. I started to fight with that, I'm going to say that your core properties that you have, because I was that mental, nothing can hurt you as you get from your hand.
I felt completely weak myself.
I worked, I worked, I worked on my face, and I got a disaster success.
Eventually I graduated from college.
"I had to spend four years of time from my group colleagues, and Susan Fisher, who was a adviser, agreed to take me to Princeton University, so I landed into the place where I wasn't a parent."
I was drunk.
From my first course in Princeton in the 20 minutes that 20 people hear.
It was the first night.
I was so scared that the morning was going to be opened that I called my head and said, "I'm not going to eat." He said to me, "No, you're going to do, I've come a flower in your bar.
It's going to stay and you'll do what I say,
Even if it's suspended.
You're going to do all the results you have to do.
Again, again, you're afraid, and you're going to be terrified, so if your body doesn't listen to you, "Really, it's done. I'd be able to follow!
"It's really coming out of my hand."" You'll work until you're going to say."" And I did that."
For five years, I'm reading the high level of the algae school. For a few years I'm going to Northwest, I'm moving to Harvard, working there. I don't yet think about it, but for a long time I thought, "That's not my place."
At the end of the first year I was in Harvard, I didn't talk once in the classroom for semester, and I came to my student cabinet saying, "You've got to participate in the workshop or cut it down." I didn't know it well.
In completely faint state, he went into the inside, he said, "That's not my place."
It became a turning point for me.
Because two things happened.
The first thing I realized is that I'm not going through that feeling anymore.
But he felt, and those particles were familiar with me.
And secondly, I realized he was in the right place.
So he could be able to follow it by imitation.
And I said to him, "Well, here's the whole art!
I said he would show himself out of the morning as he was here, he would show himself strong, and (Applause) you'll come into the class room and give the best gift that he was given as today," he said. She didn't have food. She didn't know he was sitting here. (Laughter) A few months later she came to me and I saw her sister, not until she felt true, but as much as she felt true.
He was changed.
I would like to tell you too,
Imagine it until it's true.
Show yourself so far as you want to be one.
I want you to know that,
Cutting corrections can bring so big changes.
Now, it's two minutes that I said before.
Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.
First of a situation that you're going to be measured for the next time, try it for two minutes. At the elevator, in the whole room, behind the desk, or behind the door connected.
Do what you want to do.
Wait for your brain to get the best thing in the situation.
increase your testosterone. And reduce your cortisol.
""Oh, I couldn't show them what I was capable."" Don't let it end by persuasion."
"Look at the way, ""I'm going to get to them and show them who I am!""
I want you to share it with other people, because it's very simple.
(Laughter) Share this information and share it with people, because people who can make it are typically people who have no technology and no resources, no status and no confidence.
Pay it with them so you can use it by person.
Because only taking two minutes of attention to their bodies can significantly affect their life.
Thank you.
(Applause).
We have a lot of courage in the world.
The most thickness between their supergles is invisible.
For example, catadores, they're workers that collect recycled materials to live.
Catadores are busy a hard, honest and necessary job that's useful for all. But they don't thank them for that.
Here, in Brazil, 90 percent of the products that will be recycled — what they collect.
Most of the catadores work independent. They're flying tolls from the coast and repatriated into the center of emals.
The characters are Arabs or metallic artists that are made out of a tape or a tape that's found in a few street in Brazil, and remember gravity or street art.
And that's why I met these super-regarded superheroes.
I'm a graphist and an activist. My works are basically about social, political and environmental protection.
In 2007, for the purpose of helping the city life, I turned my job into carroaches from walls.
But this time, I also supported the catadores.
And it took more attention to my work to mix art and egg, which helped me bring these catadores into the focus and raise their confidence in themselves.
Today, they're famous in street press and social media.
In fact, since I met this world, I've always worked in this field.
I've got over 200 cars in many cities, and I've been invited to a lot of travelers and travelers in the world.
I realized that cataracts with invisibility don't belong only to Brazil.
I found them in Argentina, Chile, South Africa, Turkey, even in developing countries like Japan and the U.S.
And then I realized that more people should be attracted to this, because it was a big deal.
"After that, I made a movement under the head of ""Charrocy Beauty"" (Pimp My Carroça) (Laughter) — it's a movement that can be financially funded by the people."
Thank you.
(Applause)
"It was a big movement of people who helped him to help the catadores and the carroaches, ""Because My Carrocha.""
Catadores were supported by doctors, dentisters, pedestrians, hairstyleists, mass therapists and known professionals and healthcare services like this.
Also, when the quarks were constructed by our könies, they gave them the dragonflies to see well the beach and the city that didn't raining the protective rings.
They also took other tools for security: elastic lenses, signals and mirror.
Eventually, they woke up by the street artists, and they became part of this great and large shipwreck.
"""Because I'm beautiful."" He went out to San Paul, Rio de Janeiro and the streets of Kuriibita."
"And by inspiration from TEDx to bring students across cities outside Brazil, we created a Pimpx version of the people who was facilitated and funded by the people, created free."
So everyone would be able to join.
"In two years, 170 catedors, 800 volunteers and 200 street artists, and over 1,000 donors have been involved in the movement of ""Charrocy Beauty," which was repatriated even in local schools with their help."
Now, catadores would have become people who were respected and valued as they were put invisible in reality and when they went.
Because of their magnificent characters, they could come against courageous ideas, they could increase their income and their relationship with society.
Now, I'm calling you to find catadores and other invisible super heroes in your city and recognize them.
Try to see the world as a whole without boundaries and curves.
Don't believe if you want to believe, there are more than 20 million catadores in the world.
So when you see one next time, know them as part of our community.
Mike Orbigado, thank you.
(Applause)
On November 5, 1990, a person called Al-Syyid Nosair went to a hotel in Manhattan by sending a prisoner to the leader of the Jewish Democratic League.
He first knew he was innocent from the death of Nosair, but when he was punished for the snowmasses, with other criminals in New York's community, a series of attacks, including the tunels, the Senegalers and the headquarters of the U.N.
Luckily, plans were underestimated by the FTB staff.
But unfortunately, in 1989, the World Heritage Centre couldn't prevent bombing.
And finally, Nosair could be blamed together in the southwest.
Al-Syyid Nosair is my father.
In 1983. In Pennsylvania, in Pennsylvania, in Pennsylvania, I was looking forward to the world as a child of a mysterious American engineer and compassionate American, bibty class teacher. They didn't let me come from their hands to live a happy childhood.
After I was seven years old, my relationship started to change in my family.
My father caused me to see the side of the Islam, including many Muslims, which is very little person's witness.
And from my life experience, I learned this: after people recognize each other enough, it doesn't actually take a long time to understand that each of us are the same expectations of life.
In every single language, we can find people who are strong against their faith in every nation, and others who are willing to take hand in any way to drive their own lives.
A couple of months ago, my father stood in front of me and told me that they went to policing training in London in the last few weeks with his friends.
And I said I'll go with her tomorrow.
We arrived to the Calverton Collider Police, and at that time, we didn't know that it was in the secret evidence of FTB there.
When my grandmother arrived to me, my father helped me keep my neck in my flower and understood how to target the 30 meters of breath.
The last fire lamp that I took on that day came out to the tiny narcissic lamp on the nectar, so it was collapsed. Everyone was surprised by it, especially I.
And I went back to the other men and said, "Iyan Abuh," from Arabic, "It's the fish of the father."
They all laughed at this word called, but after a few years, I realized what they were actually smiling.
They thought that my father was powerful, and the fear was also seen in me.
In the last end, these people were familiar with the furcon full of 700 kilograms of explosive matter exploding when the World Trade Center fell underneath the North Coast, because six people died and more than 1,000 people died.
And I've taken these people a sacrifice to myself, and
"Amam" was the people I called Amy.
As I was 19, we changed our living room 20 times, and this shift that was moving across my childhood caused my friends to have little.
It became one of us that we didn't feel close to myself and we didn't move to other cities.
As a new one, I was always turned to the goal of the kids who were habitually educating.
I kept my identity hidden from my classmates to not be in the center of difficulty, but it became so clear that it sufficiently sufficiently to have the highest and highest score of the new student.
That's why I spent a lot of my time reading books at home, watching TV or playing games.
So I had disagreement in my social communication skills, not prepared to the real face of life as a rock fanist family growing up.
I grew up in a environment where people were judged because they were influenced as religion and religion.
So what happened to open my eyes?
One of my first experiences that directed me to this sort of mind was in the president election of 2000.
I got the opportunity to participate in the National Children's Act in Filadelf under the University preparation program.
The group I realized was mostly directed to violence among the children, and as one of the children who were suffering most of their lives, I was not a big deal against the issue.
The members of our group were different ways of life past people.
I learned that one of the children I met in the last days of the convention was Jewish.
This fact has been found only for a few days, but anyway, I realized that understanding between us was not a hostile.
I didn't have been a Jewish friend before, and I said it's fair, because I felt angry because I realized that the barry that I was inevitable for my life.
And one more important turning point was the work I found in the busch Garden fun park in the summer for extra gain.
I was in the center of people from different beliefs and cultures here, and it played a fundamental role in the development of my experience.
I learned that a large part of my life was a crime of homosexuality, and in general, all the gees have an meaning effect.
The work came so that I had the opportunity to work with gay artists in one of the shows, while many of them were the most good and fruitful people I saw now.
I found that, as a very young person in the childhood, it's a sense of being formed in me as a part of the suffering of others, and that's a sense of commemorating someone I don't want to deal with myself.
As I felt this, I was able to compare stereotypes that were taught to me from childhood to a real life experience.
I'm not aware how it feels to be a forest, but I'm very well familiar with what the pencil is because of the reasons that doesn't matter you.
"And then, it became ""The Daily Show."" John Stüart brought me to be honest with myself about my respect to the fanaticity, and he helped me to realize that human race, religion and sexual orientation were not about the quality of his jazz."
John Stüart, in the moment I needed my father, he had put me into the real sense of the word.
The government comes from where it's not expected for a lot of time, and the fact that the Jewish comedian showed me more positive effects on my world's view than my extreme father.
One day of the days, I was proud of my mom and my world encounter changed, and my mother told me a word that I couldn't get out of my heart for my lifetime.
My mother looked at me with the eyes of fatigue, like one who lived enough dopmatism throughout his life, and said, "I was tired of hate people."
In one moment, I realized how meaningful energy it required to tell the part of anger.
Jacques Abraham is not my real name.
I changed my name when I decided to begin with my relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I miss myself, risk it going to be?
The cabby is quite simple.
I hope that perhaps somebody who's born to violence ever heard my story and has a difference between what's the way that's better. I wasn't fanatic despite the violence, not tolerating ideology.
Instead, I chose to use my life experience that I earn as a fight against terrorism and fanalism.
I'm doing this for terror victims and their fans, the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism lived to them.
I'm going to review my father's movements, not underneath in front of such a strange activity because of terror victims.
As a simple example of my talk, I'm the real evidence that violence is not supposed to pass through religion and race and go through the path of the boy's father.
I'm not like my father.
(Applause) Thank you all. (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) (Applause)
Good morning!
Are we blind?
They took the name written on them. But I wanted to ask you. Is there someone on top of his grandmother writing the name in Arabic?
Someone wrote? Nobody? Well, there's no problem.
One day ago, I was sitting with my friend in the restaurant and offering dinner.
"I looked at the office and I said, "Do you have a teacher? (Laughter)"
He looked strange at me thinking he heard the word wrong.
"He said, ""Look? (In English)" I said, ""Meny, (Laughter) No honor."" He said, ""You don't know what they say to him?"" "Yes.""
"He said, ""No! It's called him a menu or a menu."" Is my French demand hot?"
"Well, let's work with it!"" He said to the office."
"He was fascinated by talking to me. He said to himself, "If he was the most wreckest girl in this world, I didn't look at her side!""
What does it mean not saying the word ""Menu"" in Arabic?"
And with two words, the girl of Lebanon, the young boy, kept in reality and argued as ignorance.
How could he speak this kind of kind of thing?
At that moment, I started thinking.
It inspired me.
It's worth the real treasure of the man!
They don't accept me because I'm speaking in my own language in their own country.
Where can this happen elsewhere?
How did we fall here?
But we're pretty here, there's a lot of people here like me that they get to a stage in their own lives that they just take hand of everything that happened with them in the past to say they are modern and cultural.
Should I forget all my culture, my ideas, my mind and my memories?
Children's experiences about war could be our best experiences!
I've learned Arabic to just adapt everything I've learned
Should I forget to be one of them?
Did I understand here?
Despite all of these, I tried to understand him.
I didn't want to judge him with the wreck that he argued me.
Arabic doesn't respond to the needs of this day.
It's not the language of science, it's not the language of research, or it's not the language that we rely on to present a wide research project that we're used in our universities where we're used to work. And it's not the language that we use in our airport.
If we did that, they would cut our clothes.
So where should I use my language? We all have to ask this question!
You want to use Arabic. Where should we use?
It's a reality.
But there's another more important reality that we have to think.
Arabic is a native language.
In study, it's said you have to be perfect in your native language to be perfect in other languages.
It's a condition to express ideas in perfect other languages in native language creative.
How?
When he started writing, he used Arabic when he started writing for the first time.
All his ideas, images and catastrophes have been created by the little boy in the village who was raised by a particular voice heard.
So when he started writing in English, he had enough basis.
Even when he writes in English, when he read his books, you feel that box, you pass those pieces.
You can imagine that the boy from the mountains of Lebanon, who is written in English.
It's a mission that nobody will argue.
Secondly, it often says that if you want to kill a nation, the only way to kill a nation is to kill his language.
It's a reality that developed communities know.
Germaners, Frenchers, Japanese, Chinese — these nations are different from this race.
So they're legal to protect their own languages.
They sacred it.
So they use language production, they pay a lot of money to develop language.
Do we know more of them?
Well, we're not from the advanced world, but this mental idea hasn't yet come to us, and we wanted to step up with the cultural world.
Once they took research, which was like us, but for development, and when they took out countries like Turkey, Malaysia and so on, they carried their languages with themselves, they preserved it as they couldn't buy it.
They kept the language close to themselves.
Because if you get a product from Turkey or any other place and there's no label on it in Turkish, meaning it's not the local product.
You didn't believe it was a local product.
They would be consumers like before. They would be consumers like we're in the other time as we are.
So to innovate and produce, they had to protect their own languages.
"If I say, ""Laughter, suverenity, independence."" What will this remind you?"
Don't you remember anything, right?
Who, regardless of how and why it is.
Language is not only the tool to get words coming from our mouth, it's not the tool to talk.
Language shows certain stages of our life and terminology about our emotions.
"So when we say, ""Laughter, suverenity, independence,"" in the mind of each of you, the particular images are fascinated, in the history period, there are particular particles for the day."
Language is not a single, two or three words or alphabet unification.
He's the internal idea about how we think, how we see each other, how others see us.
What's the invention?
How can you say that this person understands, or not?
"So if I say, ""Laughter, suverenity, independence" or if your son came to say, "Do you live in a period of freedom, dad?""
What do you feel?
If you don't see the problem, it's okay I'll go out and not talk to the empty place.
The idea is that these expressions remind us something special.
I have a French friend who is married to French.
I asked him one day how does the work go?
"He said, ""It's okay. But I've tried one day to translate the word "toborni" for him all night."" (Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) The woman wrote to him, ""toborni"" and then trying to explain the word all night to him."
"He didn't have a sense of his hand to say, ""How might the person be so strange?""
Does he want to suicide?
""It's me right? (It's English)" It's one of a few missions."
We started to think so that because he couldn't understand the hand, the woman couldn't tell him that word. And when he was right to understand it. His mental way is different.
"And my doctor said to me, ""She's listening to Faire with me, and one night I tried to translate it for him so that when I heard the Fair, she would feel that I felt what I felt."" And the writer woman tried to translate it for him, "I pushed my hands out of them and I'd boy you." (Laughter) And this is the problem, "And because you belong to them, I took my hands back and left you." (Laughter)"
Translate it for me.
(Applause) What did we do to protect Arabic?
We turned it into the case of civil society, and we started a campaign to protect Arabic.
"Something many people said to me, ""Why are you worried?"
"Don't forget this understanding and enjoy yourself."" There's no problem!"
"The key of the campaign for protecting Arabic was, "I talk to you from the East, and you respond to me from the West.""
"We didn't say, ""No! We don't accept it or it."" We didn't choose this way, because they didn't understand us this way."
And if someone speaks to me in that way, I hate Arabic.
We say, (Applause) We want to change our own reality and reflect our dreams, dreams and our daily lives,
We're gay in the way we think like us and think like us.
"So there was a sign where, ""I talk to you from the East, but you respond to me from the West.""
Very simple, at the same time, creative and convincing.
And then we started another campaign that was written in the torphan.
"You haven't seen this example in the sky, on the top of the coffee scene, focused on black and yellow lens, was written, ""Don't kill your language!""
Why? Really, don't kill your language.
We must also kill our language from the birth.
If we had to kill our language, we had to find our identity.
We had to find our existence.
We had to come back at the beginning.
It's also a serious issue of losing our chance to be modern and cultural.
Since then, we spread the images of boys and girls that were dressed in Arabic cultures.
""Cool"" pictures of girls and boys."
"We're very cool!"
"And someone says, ""Oh, you've worked English!"" I say, ""No! I didn't understand the word 'colate."" So, if they reject how much, they want to do it. But give me a better word to express reality better."
"I'm going to continue to say ""the Internet." I'm not going to say, ""I'm going to the world's mirror tower."" (Laughter) Because it's not fun! We shouldn't miss ourselves."
But as it comes to this point, we have to believe that if it's a problem, we have to let those who are bigger or think there's a nucleus on our face think you're going to control us or think and feel they want us.
It's the idea of being creative.
If we can't fly into the kain, or we can't fix a rock, and so on, we can be creative.
You're now a creative project for each of you.
Creativity in your native language is a way itself.
Let's start from this day.
Let's take a novel, or take a short movie.
One single novel can make us global again.
It can bring out this Arabic to become a number again.
"It's not right to say, ""There's no way to come out." There's a way to fall!"
But we have to know and believe that there's a way to come out and be part of that way of output is our obligation.
Just as simple, what can you do today?
Twits, who's twisting?
If I'm building my time, I'm going to ask you more about whether it's Arabic, English, French or Chinese.
But when you write in Arabic, don't write with the graph of Latin combined with the numbers.
(Applause) It's a disaster! It's not a language!
You'll be entering the virtual world with virtual language.
It's not easy to fly out by turning back from such a place.
This is the first thing we can do.
Secondly, there are many other things we can do too.
We haven't collapsed here today to believe each other.
We're here to get the focus on the importance of protecting this language.
Now, I'm going to open you a secret.
The body knows his father for the first time through language.
"When my daughter was born, I'm going to say to him, ""That's your father, dear. (Laughter)" I won't say to him in English, ""This is your dad, honey."" And my daughter Nura says that in the supermarket he says to me, ""Thank you very much."" I'll say to him, ""Mary, Mom," and I won't want to say, ""This is your dad, honey."" And I won't expect anyone to hear him."
(Applause) Let's break ourselves from adapting this cultural. (Applause)
I learned a few things when I did these 30-day tests.
For the experiment, I took a picture every day in a month.
I'm before I start 30-day tests
He's very bad.
In fact, they're very fun.
(Applause)
Since I read the school well, my expectations were high. I started a life of a student full of an engineer with a feeling of love, walking and walking on the road.
When I realized, it felt very miserable, insecure, I was scared of people involved, of failure from the future, and the space that I felt in me.
"As it happened, I heard a strange silence when I was crying like I did before, listening to me in the sum, leaving the room when I was listening to it, ""She is leaving the room."" I grew up at Stage,"
There was no one in the fire. And the clarity and precision of the side I heard was uncertain.
"""She opens the door."" I heard."
It was a beginning. The year came.
And in the early days, all I did in weeks later, I talked to me with the third person in the third part of the island.
"She's going to the engine."
The voice sounded neutral, silent, and even a while later, to his friend and hopeful, and I also thought that this silence reflects emotions that I didn't give overtime.
For example, when I was the source, the voice came when I was hiding my heart and my real feelings.
With this, the stories behind sense emerged: normal people don't hear sounds, and it was a serious position to hear me.
The pain that I took to my college's mind
I needed right, that interest and help, and I started talking to him about my wonderful commentary.
"For example, I was working as a student's network of campus news in the television, and at the time to the teacher's talk about the construction at night, ""I want to go, I want to go."
And then, the situation started to get out of my surveillance quickly.
I was asleep in the hospital, and then schizophrenia was put on, and then the most severe: a sadness and suffering about myself and my future, feeling of anger and suffering.
The voice I heard was not a simple life experience, but because I was convinced that it was a simptom, it started to increase my fear and resistance.
It was an aggressive issue that was directed against my mind, a kind of mental battle, which resulted in increasing the number of sounds and starting to sound more hostile and more angry.
Do you see the cockroach that's water inside?
Eventually, there was a period of fear, running and eradication, of uncertainty and disagreement that I was not in the perspective of creating peace and peace in this battle that I felt vulnerable.
Two years later, my case started to get worse.
I already had all the courage of the girl: terrible sounds, magic images, strange, unintended numbers.
Now, in the past, when I look at the famine and the arrogance of those years, I think one is dying, and one is saved.
A person who was confined and tightly knoted would be sent to the surface, and he would let me go back to someone I had to get out of that journey, and eventually I had to get involved.
Over my life, many people hurt me, and they all remember, but these moments were very weak and left compared to the people who helped me;
I believe Eleanor will be able to do that.
"And he said, "If sometimes it rains in the summer, it's certainly going on."" He said, "In 14 minutes, it doesn't be hard to thank those beautiful people who are fighting with me and for me to get rid of it and I'm going to be caught back from the desert."
Of course, it was hard to believe that the voices were before the enemy and the extent came to it, so the first important step was that I couldn't learn to understand as far as I was telling the truth before.
For example, I learned to explain the voices that are moving through those who are going to attack my house — not as a real and ordinary threat, but as a fear and a feeling of danger that I felt.
I often believed them.
One night, even I sit in the door of my parents and remember that I took the boxes to protect them from the sounds that I thought they were true.
"You can say, ""Don't work with me."
"Do I say, "Do you have a plastic sticker?"" I said. That's my strategy."
After I realized that, unfortunately, I turned myself back to psychiatry in a completely different role, with particles now-to-day, curled out of the surrendered drugs.
Now, I'm proud of being a member of the organization of Intervoice, International Women's Movement, which goes through the work of Mr. Mario Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher, taking voices into the way of life strategy, the way the voices come to be blamed, not as an anomalies, but as a gesture of schizophrenia, but as a difficult, important and meaningful thing to learn.
That kind of society is possible, even it's already building.
There's a read statement of Sweden that if the social change starts, there's no return.
You can't get the courageous person.
You can't press people who are not afraid anymore.
In the last 20 years, we're not going to spread the Earth in five continents and 26 countries, and we're not going to expand the opportunities of people who are suffering, compassion, and spiritual challenges, and become a aspirator and an application.
As Peter Levine said, it's a unique creature that has intellectual spirit to use this ability that has the instinct of human relief.
In this regard, the greatest honor for our community is to help help help someone who needs to help, to be together, to extend the hand, to share and hope to raise his suffering.
We're invisible. We're not reasonable.
We can't always take or catch what's happening in our distribution.
Light doesn't shine forever.
"As my next brain once said to me, ""Don't tell others what they say at your bar."
"talk about yourself."" Thank you very much."
(Applause)
I'm here to talk about my photograph.
But is this photography that?
Because, of course, it's not a picture you can draw with your camera.
Again, my friend to photograph started when I got my first photograph at 15 years old.
I met it with my wife who was an early artist, but in a little bit different way, because when I used the camera, I planned a kind of process before.
When you take a picture with the camera, the work is ready when you print the button of the device.
And I think photography wasn't just made of being in the right place at the right time.
I thought everyone could do that.
So I wanted to create something different, something that started to form after the centuries were drawing.
Photos like this: this is the chain that goes on on on a road of work.
But it became an unpredictable game.
And despite that, it looks close to reality.
Or pictures like that — both dark and colored, but they all directed to protect realization at a certain level.
When I say realization, I'm looking for photography.
Because, of course, these are not images that we can actually draw, but I'd like to have visible images that can be taken with a camera of something.
I'd like to have some images you'll think about to understand the future.
So it's about holding a more right idea than actually keeping a moment.
Well, where is the movement that makes it look true?
Does it relate to these details or colors?
Does it relate to light?
What's the creation of illusion?
Sometimes it's a perspective of creating illusions.
But then, how to understand the world, two-dimensional (2D) is the key to how to do it on the surface.
It's not what this reality really is, it's what what real things look to us.
So the key idea is quite simple.
I see it when I pull the real works into a place, creating a real inventor that I created a alternative reality.
I'm going to show you a simple example.
There are three numbers of physical objects that can be perfect imagined here, three-dimensional(3D) objects that are connected to our world.
But when it combine in a certain way, it looks like a three-dimensional object that's still available.
We also know it can't exist.
So we play games with our brains because our brains can't accept that it doesn't mean reality.
And I see the same process when I combine pictures.
It's actually about combining different realities.
So things that show a picture real, things that we don't think about, things that we don't think about, in our everyday lives, around us.
And when you combine pictures, it's really important to look at it, because otherwise, it looks wrong in a way.
What I want to say is there are three simple sources that we have to act to get a real result.
As you see, these images don't have a particular side.
But when it's unified, it takes something like that.
So in the first source, the perspective of combinated pictures should be the same.
Secondly, the light of the unified images must be the same.
And in these two ways, these two conditions were expected — taken from the same height and the same light.
Thirdly, it's impossible to design the picture, to distinguish where one of the shape ends and where the other starts.
It has to be unified in a way that can't be divided into how the picture is created.
We remove the boundaries between different images, using different images, using the boundaries between the angles, the contrast and the brightness, using the deepest of the area, the defaces like left and shining, and allowing it to look like a single description, although there are hundreds of such details in a way.
And that's another example.
(Laughter) People can think that's the official area and that's the bottom of my altered box.
But in fact, this picture has been completely made of combining pictures of different places.
I think it's easier to create a place, than to find a place, so you don't need to change your ideas even less.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And I knew that this idea was a few months from the winter of understanding to find different places to plan and fundamentally complete the pieces of the inventor.
For example, the fish was taken when the official fish was caught.
And the fields are different spaces.
Six pieces of water were taken in a stone ceiling.
And yes, even I painted the house on the surface of the island red to look more Swedish way.
So to get a result near the reality, I think it's possible at the scale of planning.
It always starts with a collision, a idea.
Then it comes to unify different pictures.
For example, every piece was very well planned.
And if you draw pictures well, the result can be pretty beautiful and also quite realistic.
So we have all the stuff we need, and the only thing that limits us is our imagination power.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Julian, you've been happy.
So there's been such a data that Wikipedia has published more information than the data that the whole world press published in the last few years.
Is that possible?
Julian Assange: Yeah, is it possible to be true?
Isn't it worrying that the rest of the world's media work so bad? The small group of activists can spread more information than all the world's press.
CA: How do you do that?
How do people spread these documents?
How does the principle of freedom protect?
JA: As long as we know, these are people who are disseminating information. There are different ways to get these data to us.
To avoid surveillance, encrypt information to easily spread on the Internet, we call the court of the country like Sweden and Belgium to protect the law.
It's encrypted or simple to accept information, it's looking at it as it's in ordinary news agencies, formating it — it can be a bit difficult when it's got huge databases — it's open to the community and protect ourselves against possible legal and political attacks.
CA: So the right of the document is provided. You don't know who the source of information is very often.
JA: Right. We rarely know them. If we find the source of information, we immediately destroy that information.
(Applause the phone) It's cool.
(Laughter) CA: I think it's CIA, asking TED a member's code. (Laughter)
Let's look at the holy missions.
This is the information that was broken a few years ago.
Let's look at you.
It was a story from Kenya.
Can you talk about how to cut this story out?
JA: This document is the Royal report.
After the election of 2004, it was an investigation taken by the Kenyan government.
By its election of 2004, Kenya was run by Danny Arab Mué for 18 years.
He was a dictator of my property in Kenya.
When the power of the coalization came to the Kabi government and began to deal with corruption, they published this joint report by spending two million pounds.
The government also used this report as a political force against Moya, who was the richest man in Kenya at that time and now.
It's like the holy book of Kenyan journalism.
In 2007 I went to Kenya a little bit earlier than the 28th December election, and I could get papers.
We published this report three days later when the new president Kyabi, Danny Arab Moyn, began to come up to the money of the Arab Moyn, and after that, the report became hurt by the president Kiev.
CA: The long word short — the report was not directly translated to the Kenyan press, but full-size way. And you think it changed the outcome of these election.
JA: Yes. The news was published on the Guardian's head page before, and then in countries around Kenya, Tanzania and Canubi in Africa.
The news came outside.
And in a few days, the Kenyan press began to easily write about it.
20 days later, it was published in the Kenyan press, and according to the report of the Kenyan security service, it changed about 10 percent of the voices, so it led to change the results of election.
CA: So the information you've broken has really changed the world?
JA: Yes.
(Applause) CA: And this time, there's a video about the weather cell in Baghdad.
The video itself is a bit long. It's a short clip shape.
First of all, I'm saying, there's a little violence in this video.
Radio: ... stupid, if you just open them up.
Now they look, they look at Xamar.
It's alive. Father.
It's the news when you see everybody. Thank you.
Shoot them all.
Father, fire!
(Laughter from the automated weapon) Take it, continue. (Laughter from the automated weapon) I'm sorry.
Hotel... Bushmaster Two-Six, Bushmaster Two-Six,
He had to come back, now!
It was, we killed all of eight people.
There are two vertolytes, we continue to fire.
He was. They all died.
Two-Six, two-Six, we're in motion.
Oops. Sorry. What was he?
Zibil, Kyle. Aha, has been solved, huh.
CA: How did the impact of this video happen?
JA: It became heavy for people who were healthy at this job.
Two people were sent to jail to study this video.
It's actually one of three attacks in the video.
CA: If I don't judge, 11 people died in this attack, including two Reuters employees, right?
JA: Yes. Two Reuters workers died, two children were blessed.
And in total, 18 to 26 people died.
CA: The publication of this caused a wide collision.
What do you think the main reason for this anger and collision was?
JA: I don't know exactly, I think people have seen the inequality of power.
The Apocalypse vertolyot that flew over people who fly quietly to the coral is frown by 30mm coral — and without any reason — and they kill even those who saved the wound.
There were also two journalists who were accurate who were not a prisoner, and who saw their own work.
CA: The U.S. security officer, Bradley Manning, was arrested, and he said, with video in the question room, he said that 280,000 US embassy wrote letters to you.
Is that true?
JA: We rejected what we received these books.
Five days ago, 150,000 years ago, they've been arrested after they've cut 50 out of their own writing.
Last year, we published the official documents of the U.S. embassy in Reykjavik. But they don't have any relationship with that work.
I traveled myself to that embassy.
CA: If you had received the diplomatic documents of the U.S. embassy?
JA: We would publish them. (CA: Did you do that? JA: Yeah. CA: Why? JA: China finds the case of human rights in Arabian countries, like what it's true in such documentaries.
If you open the secret document, there's this type of material.
CA: Let's talk about it a little bit more detail.
In general, what kind of ideology do you stand?
What do you consider the publication of hidden documents basically right?
JA: There's such a question that what information is important for the world, which information can lead to reproduction.
In fact, there's a lot of changes.
It's a sign that the emergence of those news that are working on the economic power of the institutions to hide is something new and good, and the institutions that have these data know how to hide data themselves.
That's always what happens in practice. The history of journalism also depends on it.
CA: But it's not a bit dangerous, it may be a bad result for people, even for all the community, not depend on you.
JA: That's still not what happens in the data that we've spread.
So we have a policy to protect against damage.
There are some personal data that are communicating with those people themselves and then publishing them.
There are also legal secrets — for example, advice with the patient's doctor, such secrets are protected by the law. But we work with news carriers who really know what it does.
CA: So all know their work well.
"If someone who serves a son in the U.S. office came up to you and said, ""You know you published in your industry that someone wanted to spread with any purpose?" This video."
The American soldiers show people laugh when they die.
It shows millions of people in this world that American soldiers don't have human particles. It's not really.
"My son isn't like that. What courageous do you do this motion?"" What would you answer?"
JA: So there's a lot of cases.
But remember that people in Baghdad, Iraq, Afghanistan don't need to see this video; they see it every day.
They don't change their minds. They don't change their minds, their particles.
That's what they see every day.
It's going to change the relationship of people who pay money for this war. That's what we're doing.
CA: So you have to find a way to reveal the secret of government and companies.
Lighting is good.
But the strange thing is that to shine secrets, you have to hide your own sources.
JA: It's not exactly that. There's still no one who has gone against the Wikipedia.
Or we don't have any data against any sources.
If it's a lot of things, it might be hard for us. We work so that people who work with us are trying to help us continue their work if they're suffering from us.
CA: And what do I think about this is what I've heard like now — I'm also interested in — TEDsters?
There are two kinds of ideas about WikiLeaks and Juliet.
One — the hero that illuminates the connection things.
It's dangerous.
Who thinks it's strange?
How are you going to be dangerous?
JA: Well, there must be a couple of people without anything.
CA: These were my property people, Juliet.
We have to try a little bit more. Let's show another example.
I think it's not published this time yet, but it's going to be published at TED.
It's a interesting fact that happened recently, huh?
What's this document?
JA: It's an example of what we see every day.
Last year — November — in Albania, there were explosions like the Gulf of Mexico, even though it wasn't strong as the Gulf.
We received such a engineering report that was actually done by the way the explosion was exploded by the truck cars that the protectors of digital companies put in.
The Albanian government and other people had good here...
And the military report didn't have any relationship with them. It was a bit hard document.
We didn't know exactly who he wrote and what he was about.
We were a little bit suspected that dance could also be a game of the oil company.
"So we looked at the documents, and we wrote the answer like this, ""We're a little doubt."
We don't even know how to do.
"It's good. It looks correct, but we can't confirm."" One week ago we asked the source of information, and we answered the company who wrote this text — (Laughter) it was written like this, ""We want to find the source of information."" We said, ""Don't give information a little bit."
In general, what document do you talk about?
Do you belong to you as legal?
"You're really?"" They said, in response, they sent the text of the owner of the document together to delete Microsoft Word ID on the screen."
That's how it would cut.
(Applause) So there's a lot of cases.
One of the ways to determine the source of material is one of the methods that try to write a letter.
CA: Do you have information about the GDP?
JA: Yes, and so many, but we're now working on funding for the website, and engineers come out of their hands.
We've reduced the news released because we've tried to rediscover the basics of the website in the last few months to protect our recent public interests.
It's a little problem.
As institutions starting in another new activity, we're also getting out of the challenges that we raise from one. We don't have enough employees to emit and publish all these data, although it's already included a lot of information.
CA: Do you say that the key volunteers that you need are paid to pay to journalists and/and young journalists?
JA: Yes. People we're going to believe.
It's also hard to develop from one to a little bit of the data that we have in our hands to get in a different way, and we need people who can deal with high-level and now security problems.
CA: So can you say why this work starts?
I mean, I didn't read at the hard time that you changed 37 schools when you were children.
Is that true information?
JA: My parents were in a movie business, and I didn't run from religious meetings, which was the result of both...
(Laughter) CA: Psychologists would accept that as a paranormal sense.
JA: Are you looking for film business?
(Laughter) (Applause) CA: Because I know, when you were young, you were also a chaker, you had a problem with writers.
JA: I was just a journalist.
I was one of the young journalists as an activist.
I was arrested as a journalist I published when I was young.
You need to treat hackers a little bit careful.
It's possible to do different things in the way of hierarchy.
Unfortunately, most of the Indian hackers are engaged to steal money on the bank account of our grandfather for Russian mafies.
The Xarkers sales are not like before now.
CA: I don't think you've been engaged to steal someone's grandmother's money. What are the main values?
Can you give short information about them, or talk about why they make them or events?
JA: There's no event, and I think.
But my core values: I think powerful and courageous people don't make victims; they help victims.
And that's what I learned from people who were courageous as my father and dad in my life.
CA: Don't it make human victims of adulterer, adulterer; protects them?
JA: I'm a little prosecutors, I'm not fully protecting them and showing them out, but the whole way — I'm protecting victims to detect people from crime.
And that's my character that I have for a long time.
CA: Can you talk about what is in Iceland short in the last few minutes?
According to the data that you published there, it became a problem with the bank, and the news agent that kept the information was also sent to a court.
Instead, the website was arrested.
You made a good imagery in Iceland. Then what happened?
JA: That was a big issue.
Iceland was a economic crisis.
It was one of the biggest fractures in the world.
The Global Commerce from the banking sector was 10 times more than the other areas.
We published this information in July of last year.
"5 years ago, five years ago, it was released on public television, and it was sent to TV a court court court court, five years ago, and it started, and the researcher didn't know what to do, "That didn't have happened. What should we do now?""
We published news instead of television on the web page. We were very prisoner in Iceland, even going here and talking about it.
In the community, everyone was confident that this would happen again. Soon, after we met some Icelandic politicians and international experts, a new law project was introduced to the Iceland government that would be prosecutors, one of the most basic laws in the world that serve journalists to protect, equal to Nobel Holocaust for freedom of speech.
Iceland could be included in the system of other skandinavi countries, equal to Norway.
And just a month ago, this law was secretly accepted in the Icelandic Parliament.
CA: Wowu
(Applause) So let's ask, July,
How do you believe that it's going to be coming? Will your interest control everything secretly in the way of the Great Wall, or will people like to control the Great Wall, or otherwise?
JA: I'm not quite sure what it will be.
All over the world — from the U.S., to China and to the U.S. everywhere, the needs of freedom of speech and copyright are increasing.
It's hard to see how it's going to come.
The time we live is very interesting. We can change everything to a very courageous surface.
CA: I think what our audiences mean, Juliet, be careful, be powerful with you.
JA: Thank you very much, Chris. (CA: Thank you.) (Applause)
I'm a writer.
Tell a story and writing a novel is my job. I want to tell you a little bit about the art of writing a story today, and I'm going to talk a little about the monkeys called cinus.
But let me talk short about my personal story before you start them.
I'm going to use words, and I'm going to use the words, and you're going to find a few things when I hear my voice.
I was born in a Turkish family in Sri Lanka.
A little bit after that, my parents get married, and I came to Turkey equal with my mom.
Since that time, I grew up as a kid alone in my mother's poem.
In the 1970s, the situation in Angola was a little strange.
Most of the families in our neighborhood were large families that were father's family chairman. I grew up with my mother who was the only married woman in the patriotical environment.
In fact, I grew up in front of two groups of women.
On the one hand, it was a rich, global, modern, European Turkish woman — mom.
On the other hand, the rest of care, the faithful, less savvy, less rational grandmother was standing.
My grandmother looked at the coral rest in the iron box, and she was sort of looking at the structure to remove the devil's eye.
Deep boys in their eyes, people who were losing their hands, went to visit the grandmother.
Every time my grandmother would paint something in Arabic, hit as much gold ticks as the losses of getting red in his hand.
Then each other would be surrounded by complexity.
A week later, he was going to go to the sick hemorrhage teacher.
I know that it can sound strange to talk about it in front of such a scientific xadrez and a savvy man, but I didn't see that anybody who came back to my grandmother's ambulance or ambulance came back to cure of different curves.
I asked my grandmother how he did. That was the power of the divine?
"He said, ""Because there's good for the gods, but it's the power of the fundamental things."" In my teachings from him, there's a lot of important lesson. If you want to do something in life, whether you want to get rid of it, whether it's a genius or the soul of the human, you need to take it into the loop with the wall."
It's built and it's going to stay inside.
We all are now inside social and cultural areas.
We're all in it.
We're all born to a certain family, chalk, synthesis.
But when we can't connect to one day beyond the world we belong, when we're far away, we're confronted with the risk of building from inside.
We can reduce our ability to tolerate. Our heart is suspended. When we stay very long in the environment, we can lose our sense of humanity.
If our friends, our neighbors, our collaborators, our family embarkes us, and if we read a lot, it means ourselves are surrounded by the opposite of us.
In Turkey, women like my grandmother do something like this, they cover the face of the mirror with artificial pieces, or turn the face of the mirror back to the wall.
It comes forward to the belief that exists in the East. It's not healthy to look at its image for a lot of time.
However, it's one of the biggest dangers of our world where living in the icebergs that share reading ideas.
And it's happening everywhere, between liberals and gentlemen, agnostic and faithful, rich and poor, in the East and West also.
We form groups based on fluctuations and similarities, and we create stereotypes about others.
I don't think, writing industry can be the key way to cross these cultural gettos.
Even if stories can't destroy the boundaries, they can detect fluctuations on the surface of our minds.
We can also like to see the other worlds by looking at these fluctuations, even by seeing them.
When I was eight, I started writing stories.
One day, my mom gave me a flower in color and said that my personal stories would be a good idea to write here.
Now, I think it was a little fear of my mental interpretation at that time.
I couldn't share my stories with my family at home, but it wasn't so good that I couldn't talk to my dream friends.
I was a kid inside, introverted, so my mother thought it was a good idea to write my daily regrets to my mom.
But he didn't know that I was thinking that my life was really tough, and what I wanted to do was to write about this uninteresting life.
Instead, I started writing not about myself, but about others and things that weren't.
That's how I started to become a writer who would become my love of life.
Before writing was for me the life of more others, the stories of others than the autobiography manifest.
(Laughter) (Laughter) And I'm talking about these things that are happening in my life.
Another thing happened in the desert of this area.
My mother became a diplomat.
I also ran out of this small, curiosity, medium-sized environment, into the international school environment in Madrid. I was the only Turkish at school.
"I first landed in a difficult environment that I mentioned here as ""typical external," which was the difficult environment that I was expressing out here, and there were children from all nations in Senegal, but it created an egalitary democratic engine that would be observed at no cosmopolistic or at class."
In fact, in this museum, children were considered to represent their personalities, not their own, but a larger nation.
We were like the United Nations, and it was also fun, except having happened a bad event in behalf of any nation, or having a conversation from language.
So the child became a source of malaria, it was always incidented.
And I remember well that when I arrived at this school, Turkey became a military convergence, Turkish armed attempted to kill Papan, and Turkey gathered zero numbers in the Eurasian music contest.
(Laughter) At that time, I often wanted to run from school and become a marine.
That's the first time I saw the concept of cultural stereotypes in this school.
"And all the kids asked me about ""Midnight Express," which I didn't look at, and they asked me how many cigarettes I smoke per day, because they drank all kinds of cigarettes. When I started, they asked me to cover my head."
I learned three strereotypes about Turkey here, these were: politics, cigarette and head cover.
After Spain, we returned to Ireland, Germany and back to Angola.
I thought I was the only trip box that I could carry my talent and my dream power with myself, all of these trips.
Stories gave me a sense of unity, continuity and perseverance — I was poor of these particles in real life.
When I was 20 years old, I moved to the city of Estonia, which I loved very much.
I lived in a very cosmopolistic and living environment, and I wrote one of my novelers here.
In 1999, when I was sick in Estonia, I was there.
The stage that I saw when I was out of the building that was fast at three in the morning stopped me.
He had a hisly, old seller, who didn't sell alcohol in his store, who didn't talk to other people and marginaal lives.
She was sitting on his head with a long black pair, a long transcual that was spread on his eye.
I also saw that the cigarette offered him from the cigarette that she was getting out of the knife with the vibrating hands of the cockroach, and that's the rest of my mind that night was the stage — taking cigarettes along the way of a transsexual that was crying with a protector.
When we're confronted with death and explosions, our global differences are eliminated, even though we're all one for a few hours being erupted.
And I've always believed that stories have a visual effect.
I don't want to say that nature is strong as a failure. But when you read a good novel, it's far away from our little comfortable room, we start to recognize people we never encounter in the dark of the night, and sometimes we don't think good about it.
Shortly after that event, I went to the girls college in Boston, then in Michigan.
It was not only a geographical basis, but also a complete change from my view of language.
I started writing English.
It's war, it's impossible, it's impossible. They ask me why I'm writing in English. It helps me change my text language.
I love writing in Turkish, I become more poetic and emotionally, and I love writing in English, I think it's more mathematical and meaningful.
I think I'm connected differently to every language.
Like millions of people around the world, I learned English later. English is a language of winning later.
When you learn any language later, you're also allowed to lose what they've learned.
As language comes later, we want to speak more, to work better words, to do better infections. We're finally talking less, because there's a huge difference between our brains and our language.
This difference is scary.
But if we learn not to be afraid of it, it can stimulate us.
And that was what I learned in Boston — it was a glimpse and a flute stimulus that I lived.
In those moments, my grandmother who followed all my actions from day to day — with increasing anxiety, also involves me to marry my day-to-day prayers, and I could just place together after her mind, just after her blew.
Because God loved my grandmother, I built my family life.
(Laughter) But instead of deciding somewhere, I went to Arizona.
And because my wife was in Estonia, I started to go and go through the Arizona East, and I couldn't feel so much different at the other two points of the world.
I mean, a piece of my thing has always been moving, from physical and spiritual viewpoint.
Like my stories to keep all my memories and parts in me are always with me.
And I think it's going to lose his magic when it's more really connected to the story than the story.
I'd like to take the same idea about that question with you.
One of the things I wrote in English, when I saw light face in America, one of the social revisors made a comment like this.
"I liked the book." He said, "But if you wrote a little bit different.""
(Laughter) I asked what he meant.
"And he said, ""And if we look at you, we're going to see that many Spanish, American, American, Spanish heroes, but there's only Turkey that he's a man."" And it's actually waking out in the university camp in Boston. It's normal to me because there's more nation than Turks being heroes. But I understand what the audience wants to say."
But I also know him that I'll always continue to animate him.
He always wanted to be my personal manifest.
He wanted to be a Turkish woman in the book because I was a Turkish woman.
We're always talking about changing the world of stories, so we can also see that politics has affected the spread, the lecture and the understanding of the movement.
Most writers, especially not the westers, are suffering from this pressure.
If you're a woman from the Islamic world like me, they're waiting to write about the Islamic woman, it's better if this Muslim woman isn't happy.
They're looking forward to write more informative, irritable, typical stories, to be far away from the west edge.
When I was a kid, in Madrid, the prbolems that I met have also existed in India's world literature.
Writingers look like not as creative people with personal ideas, but as representatives of cultures and countries. A few writers from China, a few from Turkey, a few from Nigeria.
They're looking forward to not to the individual, but to adapt to our civilization.
In 1982, when they took an interview from the writer and the traveler James Baldw, they asked him several times about homosexuality.
"The person who took it, when he tried to appreciate it as a blue writer, Walwin stopped and said, ""You don't see that I have anything else that's not there?" And the same as what I have in everything."" When politics markes us, our imagination is under danger."
There's an unstable catalyst called multitasking literature, which is used for all writers who are not from the west.
About 10 years ago, I remember the first multitasking lecture at Harvard.
We were three writers, a man from Philippines, a man from Turkey, and one from Indonesia to Latin.
(Laughter) If we brought us together, we didn't have a moral or a moral obligation.
It was only our passports.
The writers from another nation are waiting to write real stories.
There's a function in nature.
In this way, not only writers, but their work heroes become representatives of a larger mass.
I have to realize that such a approach to the story is not only available in the West.
That's how in the whole world.
I saw this for the first time when I was arrested in 2005, because of the story of the centuries.
I worked to write a constructive, multi-dimensional work about Turkish and Turkish family with the eyes of women.
When I was attracted to the court, my little story became a big macro problem.
Because I wrote about Turkey and Armenia's conflict, some looked at me, some looked at me.
But at that moment, I would like to say both sides that it's just literature.
It's just a story.
"I don't want to reduce the value of the work I've seen when I say, ""It's just story.""
I love and support it because it's not because it's how nature is understood, but because it's how it is.
The writers are known for their chess perspective, but political books are enough today, and literature is not the language of everyday politics.
"Cexov said, ""The correct way of resolution and the correct layout of the matter is completely different concepts."
"And doing the second is the work of the artist."" politics separates us from each other. Nature unites us."
Some of them are surrounded by evolution.
It's a great difference.
One takes the boundaries.
The street doesn't know the boundaries.
politics was made of a strong wreck.
Nature is waterless.
"In the Osman's period, there were people who would say a surface story called ""moth," and they would go to the cafeteria, say stories that were very often awkward in front of the audience."
They would change their voices to express the different images in the story, they would shake them.
Everyone would go to listen to him, ordinary people, even kingdom, Muslims, non-Muslims.
"The equals would cross the boundaries. It would be like Middle Asia, North Africa, Balkans and Asia, which was spread to ""The Naft of Middle World.""
Today stories continue to cross the boundaries.
When Palestinian and Israeli politicians speak, they don't listen to each other. But the work of a Palestinian reader read the work of a Palestinian writer, the work of a Palestinian writer, communicating with the story path.
Nature needs to take us closer.
If you don't do it, it doesn't mean good work.
Books saved me — a kid who was for some time embarrassed and shameful.
But there's also a threat to budgeting books.
After the writer and the lawyer Rumi met his spiritual wife with the Sams Library, the first thing of Shamen was to hit Rumi's books into water and love the destruction of those written in him.
"So we say, ""The knowledge that doesn't make you away from you, it's better than ignorance."" The problem of the cultural gettos today is not lack of intelligence and knowledge. We know very much about each other, we think we know more true. We don't get away with the knowledge that we're able to get away from ourselves, we're elitar, we're away from others and we're breaking our relationship."
There's a similarness I love: living like the motion of the comet.
One of the letters of the kompass becomes stable.
And the other thing, the other thing, is that it makes me cool, and it's rotating.
That's how my works are.
One of the works that I wrote is that Iceland has moved to Turkey, and another part is moving around the world, connecting between different cultures.
In this regard, my work considers both local and universal, and I believe that it's relevant here and everywhere.
You're probably seeing the Barefoot House, which was the west of the Armenian soldats for 1400 years.
In the House, there's a place called the House of Cinco Meetings, right now from the coastal room.
That's the place between buildings.
I like this approach very much.
We usually don't believe the regions that are between something.
We consider that places are made of fireless fire, and we consider the margin of frog-law creatures, which are symbolized as a symbol of change.
And I think the institutions that are in the background should be the field of artists.
I prefer changing and multitasking when I write.
I love to think about the next 10 pages.
I love my heroes surprise me.
In one of my novel, I can talk about a Muslim woman. And I'll probably have a happy woman. The characters of my other work can be a bright blue professor from Norway.
As long as we come from inside, we can talk about everything.
"Audo Lorde says, ""Our intelligent fathers say, "I think I can say, ""And he says, ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry."" I think it was a great example."
And I don't understand why when we still teach writing, we say write about things you know for students.
Maybe it's not too good for the start.
Creativity doesn't matter who we are, what we know and how we have personality.
We have to teach young people and each other to write about what we feel open-heartedly.
We have to take away from cultural gettos, we have to recognize other worlds.
It's like the dragonflies that are sort of drawing things, like the dragonflies that are in the period.
Not depending on the political situation, they combine all the universe. And that's a good news.
"I wanted to end my grandmother with an old river of water, ""Come familiar, be friends, put the work on the road; love; the world is a fan world."" Thank you very much."
(Applause)
My big idea is a little idea that will discover millions of big ideas hidden inside us.
My idea is sleep this little.
(Laughter) (Applause) Here are women who belong to the group A. The rest of the poor
They're women.
I also realized the value of the sleep hardly.
Two and a half years ago, I lost my breath from fatigue.
My head stood on the table, my face blew, five screws hit my right eye.
I started to understand the value of the skin at this time.
In that period, I studied, talking to doctors, scientists, as a result I can tell him that the only way to be more productive, to be happy is to sleep normal.
(Applause) In this way we're going to start with women.
We're going to be the most standing in the real sense of the word.
(Laughter) (Applause) Because unfortunately, less sleep is considered igidity for men.
In the recent time, when she was getting married to a man, she started talking about she slept four hours before the night.
"I went through my faith, I said — of course I didn't say — ""You know it,"
"If you were five hours, the Indian nahar would be more interesting?"" (Laughter) Most men sleep less."
"So here, in Washington, you want to invite somebody to dinner tomorrow, and you ask, ""What's the eighth?"" The big possibility is, ""8 very late, but it's not going to do anything, it's going to play a little tennis, then I'll meet you a few places."" They think they're already busy and productive, but I think they're not so, because it's enough leaders that do very bad decisions in economic, political, commercial matters."
Having high IQ
Being a good leader is not to be a good leader, to be a good leader is to see the insert Titanic before it hits.
Insects that make our Titanics are enough.
I think the Lechenman Brothers would still be thanked if they had Lechen Brothers and their sisters.
(Applause) When the girls were busy 24 hours seven days, the sisters who were sleeped seven and a half hours or eight hours would see Azerbaijan, maybe they could understand why it would happen.
In a period that we face with a lot of fractures, whatever is useful for ourselves, happiness for our lives, all that's effective is the best for the whole world, regardless of where we live.
I'm going to evolve again to discover the power of the door to see the big ideas that are in us, shut your eyes, the devices out, discover the power of the sleep.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I was like a baby who had a woman's body.
If you see the brain, you can see that the brain is made of two separate hemispheres.
Sorry for a minute. Thank you very much. It was fun.
The past information to energy has spread across all the sensory systems at the same time, which tells us how the indicating moment looks like, how it smells, how it feels and how it sounds.
We're an energy that's connected to the energy around us through our right hemisphere.
At this point, we're perfect, full and blind.
And my left hemisphere is a completely different place.
The left hemisphere thinks methodically.
And our left hemisphere thinks in any language.
And the only thing I could do was external energy — power.
"To me, ""What are you going to see me?"
I feel angular in my body. Imagine:
