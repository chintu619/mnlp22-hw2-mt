I was 11 years old. I remember one of the morning, as I heard of the joy sounds in our house.
My father heard the news of the BBC in the radio.
And there was a shame that we didn't have been habituated at that time, because the news was quite irritating him.
"My father said, ""It's taken back to the Taliban.""
I didn't understand what it means, but I didn't know how happy my father was.
"You can go to the real school."" My father said.
It was a morning I couldn't know.
It's really going to school.
I had just six years old when I had a school for girls who went to Afghanistan.
So in the next five years, I had to go as a boy to go to the secret school, and I had to get my kid who had been prohibited to go to the prison.
And that's the only way we can't study each other.
We're going every day in a different way that nobody can't worry about where we go.
We've put our books into the market torpes, just because we're going to shop.
The school was inside a house, more than 100 people were embedded in a flat room.
The winter was comfortable, but it would be terrible.
Our teachers, teachers and parents — we can all risk our lives.
Of course, the Taliban had been connected for a week for the suspects of school.
We've always been afraid of what we know.
Maybe they're looking at us?
Can they know what we live on the floor?
We were afraid, but again, school was the place we wanted to be.
I was really lucky because I grew up in a family that would value education, and I grew up in a couple of girls.
My father was a high human because of his age.
There's a different thoughtman who lived in a poor place of Afghanistan, who is a girl, that's my mother, went to school, and that's why she was rejected of childhood by his father.
But my teacher was my teacher.
It's going.
Two years ago, he went out to school, and he turned our home into a school for girls and women in the village.
And my father — that's the first difference that I learned in my family.
And there was no doubt about that his kids would be trained, but they would look at the risks, despite the dangers of Taliban.
So it was more dangerous to teach kids.
In the Taliban years, it's going to go, it's time, it's time, I'm trying to be in fear and not see a light from the future.
"And my hand came to me, and my father said, ""Hey, my daughter, you can lose everything in your life."
You can be a boy in the pollen. You can be able to leave your house in the war.
But the only thing that's going to stay with you is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will sell you to school.
"Well, you're endeavorable to continue?"" Now I can't be 22 years old."
I grew up in a country that was distributed in a war for decades.
My older people could only finish a middle school of less than six percent, and if my family didn't go so much after my education, I didn't see it.
In fact, I'm based here as a Middlebury Collecte that has lost you around.
(Applause) When we returned to the village, one of the first people who invited me was my father who sent her daughter to school.
He's not because I'm a prison, but because I'm the first woman who came to the car in the kid of Kabil.
(Applause) My family believe me.
I have great lives, and my family's lives are bigger for me.
So I'm a leader of a global campaign for women called 10x10.
That's because I'm from the founders of the SOLA, the first dormant school, in a country where women are still risked to go to school.
And the most likely is that I see students who are able to benefit from the opportunities in my school.
And I see how their parents, my father, my father, are doing me, despite all those who are confronted with me, how they support their daughters.
So I can't tell you his face and his real name, but he's one of my students' father.
Approximately a month ago, when she went from SOLA to the village, he spent a few minutes before he died in the bombing out of the road.
When he came home, he put the phones, and the voice in the phone had gone up to send her girl to school, and he had to stop it with the return of his journey.
"And he said, ""If you want, then kill me,"" he said, ""But I'm not going to be afraid of that my daughter will come back to you because you're tired and compassionate thinking."" And what I've discovered about Afghanistan, some of the fact that the Western people were looking at is that it's the fact that everyone who was looking forward to death is to know the value of a girl behind each of us, and it's the support of a father who has lost his success."
This doesn't mean that our older mothers don't open our success.
In fact, parents are most analists that believe and lead girls to the light. But in a community like in Afghanistan, men's group is lost.
In the Taliban, the number of girls who went to school was measured by hundreds — as you know, this was called the Jewish universe.
But now, the number of girls who go to school in Afghanistan is over three million.
(Applause) It looks very different when Afghanistan looks looking at America.
I'm aware of what Americans see in the changes.
I'm afraid you're going to take a lot of time after the U.S. military was taken.
But when I went back to Afghanistan and I saw the validity of the children and the support of them, I grew up with a light coming and a constant change.
For my reason, Afghanistan is a country of hope and unlimited opportunities, and girls who read in the SOLA don't give me something else every day.
They're going to create great things like me.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
It's fascinating by all the way, in all the way.
It's lost in the archipelago.
It doesn't fly. We're going to go back.
One. Two. Three.
When you see the first social event.
It would have been suspected about anything.
In fact, I was very lucky, because many of the South Korea didn't have been so lucky.
He learned a new language, and after he got a job, all the lives could be built up in a little bit.
We were all Koreaans, but they were 67 years old, after they were split.
I'm South Korea or South Korea?
So I started to plan how to save them.
One who I didn't know.
That's the simulation of my life at that time.
It's a child connection that we've designed in 2007.
We put it in a form of space.
It's going to hit the period without standing on the door of the building.
If you're a gentleman, you know that kids are very lovers of flutes.
So the wall of the building looks like that.
Why did we look like this?
"And the other director said to me, ""I don't want to be a sir.""
"And I said to him, ""It's impossible."" But he asked him, ""How do you go out of my father?"
"You're going to go up when you go down."" (Laughter) I said to him, ""No."" Of course, the government workers said, ""Laughter should be absolutely.""
We applied the idea of that tower only around the trees.
There are three trees inside the building.
They allowed us to call these tours chirurgical.
But it's used for another purpose.
They're collated over the tower.
And the kids are collisioned when they go.
(Laughter) There's a little bit of 40 kids around a village.
It's like this little flower that you see in Buda that it's eating.
(Laughter) When anyone takes an event, they're sitting outside the door.
It looks very beautiful here below.
They're going to read the last parking.
(Laughter) It's time to eat.
(Laughter) (Applause) We've bought the dam as possible, because we want to see kids not just under the dam, but on the top.
If the rain is very high, it's only going to see the ceiling.
It's also a place to eat the foot — every kind of species has a water cart.
And what you see is what you want to make friends with kids, and it's going to do, and it's normal.
But the boy you see is going to take them with a crane, filling them with water.
(Laughter) It's completely open for the majority of the years.
There's no waste from water and water.
And that's that that means that the arcectura is basically made up of wood.
There are no places between the scales.
There are no acoustic ways.
Most of the kids begin to begin to begin to begin to begin to be very sick.
But there's no reason to go out in this connection.
Because there's no place here.
The police says that if he's sitting in the body, he can go out if he doesn't want to stay in the room.
It's going to go back, and it's going to go back.
(Laughter) Well, I'm going to say, and in this way, kids really like to hide.
But here they go and go back.
And that's a natural process.
Second, we consider that the voice is very important.
You know that kids are going to go better in the voice.
They don't sleep at the heart.
In our context, children show high concentration in school.
You know that our dragonflies grow in the wrong.
They need a voice.
You know that you can't easily talk to your friends.
You don't have to be sure.
You know that we're trying to control everything in the first time.
And then, it's completely open.
It's interesting that we can go to cool in the winter at 20 degrees.
And we're going to go on the door.
We're solar in 50 times.
We don't pass water.
We're getting married in rain.
So we were created to be here.
And so we have to act with kids.
And here they're trying to share sinflies.
They have to help their teachers.
But they don't do.
(Laughter) Now, this kid gets into itself.
And that's the dark room.
And that's a hand-elect.
They talk good here.
Most of the hotels have trees.
It's trying to keep the mouse on the top of the bottom.
(Laughter) Take more. (Laughter)
There's no window in every school room.
And Santa Claus comes from here in a mil.
So it's a extra surface, built on the right side of the interior.
It has a height of five meters, and it's 7 degrees.
It's because it's very expensive.
We don't think about security.
We allow a girl to study a boy.
They're trying to enter them.
It's worth.
It's good, but it's strong.
It's powerful. He's my son.
(Laughter) Here he looks like how safe it's to go from the wood.
And then we left the other kids.
You know that it's very hard in Tokyo.
(Laughter) It's trying to learn how the driver will go on the front.
In the last time, kids have a little bit of danger.
In such cases, they learn to help each other.
It's a community, and we're giving these opportunities.
This patch shows the movement of a kid from 9.10 to 9.30 to 9.10.
It's 183 meters.
And it's not white.
Of course, this bird went on six thousand meters on the morning.
But the interesting thing is still ahead.
In this connection, children move about four,000 meters per day.
Children here have the highest atletic indicators between the connections.
"The second minister always says, ""I'm not going to train them. They're just like a stroke."
"We're going to go up."" (Laughter) They fly for themselves. (Laughter)"
In my mind, we don't need to control them and actually protect them, but they should go out of all.
They have to have little concern.
Because we teach them how to live in life.
I think the heritage is able to change the world and the lives of people.
This building is one of these steps taken to change the lives of children.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In the 1970s, I worked with gymnastic for two years in China in Hunan.
When I read at the first school, I gave me a proposal that all the costs would be paid by the government for not going to go to the school of atletics.
"But my grandmother said, ""No."" My Valideans wanted me to be a engineer like them."
It was the only way to get a good income and a safe job to be happy after the National Revolution.
I don't love my job, I don't love my job.
But my desire was to be a Chinese Opera.
And so, I'm going to go to my real pianine.
You need to work with akrobatics from young years to be an Opera artist, and I've taken my hand to go to the Opera school.
I also wrote a book to our school teacher to make a radio show.
But the adults didn't like my idea.
Nobody believed I was serious.
But my friends supported me that they were happy kids like me.
So when I was 15 years old, I realized that it was night to train.
My desire never was real.
I was afraid that I would have the only chance to get the second school like the end of my life.
But that was unfair.
I decided to find another way.
Nobody will show me the way? Oh no.
I asked books.
"And I asked this book that was written by my music family to replace the advice of Valide, and I learned that I was able to be able to read this book, and if I asked a woman to write the Constitution of Fou Law, I took the free woman model from this book, I learned that I was able to read this book. ""The world is cheaper."" The name, ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" And this book was inspired me to read out."
"[""What's the collection of Sanmao's works"" (here called Echo Chan)] [""It's out of the story"" writer: Nan Huaijin] when we came to the U.S. in 1995, what's the first books I read?"
Of course, books that are prohibited in China.
The Chinese village, ""The beautiful Torpaq," is right."
There's no benefit for the Propaq. I'm going to go out.
The Bible is interesting, and it's pretty strange.
(Laughter) It's the theme of another day.
"But my fifth brother brought me light, and I said, ""You'll honor his father and his mother.""
"I thought, ""Laughter"" ""Laughter"" ""It's different and better."" So I got the opportunity to re-create my relationship with my parents from the part of the sins in the Confusiation."
And I didn't interact with the new culture gave me the opportunity to compare my readers.
This can teach you very much.
For example, this map first saw me amazing because we grew up in China by learning this map.
I didn't think that China wasn't supposed to be in the center of the world.
In fact, the map shows a look at the world.
There's no new thing with the magic.
This is a standard practice in the world of science.
But there are also science areas like comparative religion and comparative literature.
The education and the reconciliation helps students understand the whole matter.
And I thought that if you're doing a job for comparative science, why don't you create a daily life?
So I started to read books in the case of birds.
"And let's say, people who have been involved in the same event, are about the writer of Benjamin Franklin, Walter Isaacson, ""John Adams,"" or about the friends who have been part of the same property."
"[""The Story"" writer: Katharine Graham] [Laughter: Warren Buffett and Life" writer: Alice Schroeder] I'm like to read a story like a couple of January — (Laughter) [Laughter: King James Version] [Laughter] [Laughter] ""Laughter"" Christopher Moore] Or Joseph Campbell wrote the same stories in the same culture as he made in his beautiful age."" Joseph Campbell wrote to Joseph Campbell for Misal; Jesus and his prophet and his father died three times away from Bud."
For Jesus's prophet, these were economic, political and spiritual.
It's interesting for the future that all of these were psychological: fear, fear and social frustration.
And if you know foreign language, it's interesting to read books in two languages.
"[""Chuang Tzu Yolu"" writer: Thomas Merton, ""Tao: Water Area"": Alan Watts] I discovered that I didn't lose my mind, but other interesting facts."
"Laughter, I realized with the help of translations that in China, happiness is called ""happy pleasure.""
"The word coming in Chinese is expressed as ""the mother." Yeah!"
(Laughter) Books play a magic portal that I can connect with people in the past and in India.
I don't know that I'm going to be just or embarrassing again.
You don't really realize your desire compared to the difficulty of others.
I started to believe that the only purpose of the desire is not to realize.
The primary purpose of the desire is to help us connect with the point of desire, of happiness and of happiness.
There's no real desire that can do it.
Because books are because I'm here today and I'm happy. And I'm very often living with a clear purpose.
"And I say, ""The books are always with you.""
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
You don't stop it. What do we do?
"And you're looking at a person until his room, and you asked, ""What's my room?"" Well, it's the morning of Friday, and you're in office. And one of you look at a meeting in your calendar."
And I'm talking about something more valuable than the office device.
From time, from your time.
(Laughter) The key sign of the Radiation Syndrome is to accept as you see the call of meeting in the calendar. (Laughter sounds)
"It's a wonderful reflection — I'm, click, say — in your calendar, ""I'm going to go, I'm going to attend the meeting."" (Laughter sounds) It's important, right?"
Friendship is the opportunity to go in every company.
And a meeting that goes on the way can actually lead to a significant result.
We're crying. (Laughter sounds) That's not because we can't take a good meeting of that person, but that's the DRS, the Rational Syndrome, that we create itself.
In fact, I'm convinced that DRS is global epidemic.
I'm talking to you.
I put a video on YouTube for a couple of years ago, and I've lost all the worst confrontations you can't have in this video.
And that's about five minutes, the video brings together everything we hate about bad meetings.
The administrator of a meeting that doesn't want to control the class, here.
People who don't know why they're.
And he left all of them in a kind of sense.
It's a lot of smile.
(Laughter) Let's look quickly.
(Video) Now, our goal is to come into a very important issue.
Thank you, Joe. I'm working home today.
(Laughter) Hello Joe. Thank you for your stay.
One group — ding dong — (Laughter sounds) Thank you, who was involved?
Well? You don't tell me that. (Laughter sounds) Do you know?
Yes, they're going to meet me.
For a few weeks after the YouTube, 500,000 people from hundreds of countries, really from hundreds of countries, looked at this video.
And three years later, this video is looking at hundreds of years every month.
Even kids who don't see they't smile when they hear people's voice.
"I'm Michael Shermer. I'm born the Director of the Society of skeptics, ""Skeptic.""
We're looking for paranormal events, psevdo-elm, interested groups and frees. These are science, psevdo-elm, nonsense, tullant science, wudu-elm, patology theory, bad science, and so that's irrelevant.
If you're living at Mars last time, then you're very quickly confronted with these things.
Some call us a car.
But we're going to admit that car takes a lot of things.
We're as the police government's police department, and we're going to find them and find them. We're like Ralph Neyd. (Laughter) We want to change bad ideas to good.
I'm going to show you a example of a bad idea.
I've done it with myself. It gives us to explore the NBC TV.
"It's going to produce a company of ""Quadro"" in North Virginia."
"It's called ""Quadro 2000 Explorer.""
(Laughter) They sold it to school leaders for 900 dollars.
It's a plastic thing that is placed on the Radio Shack antenne.
It can be used to look for a lot of things from the search engine. But it's the only thing that the student is to look for marijuana in coffee.
(Laughter) It works like this: If you're going to go back to the coffee when you go in the coryd, you're open the coffee.
That's something.
I'll show you.
(Laughter) Hm. It's a little fruit to go back to right.
So we're going to do this, and we're going to do it again.
We're sure that it's going to go to this side.
(Laughter) Thank you, don't have compassion, you have left your cows. (Laughter)
Of course, this is the primary question: can you find the marijuana in the scales of this tool?
So this is that: Yes, you can see if you open enough coffee.
(Laughter) (Applause) We should not only follow what we found in science, but also look at what we don't find.
And that's the point that opens my short line here, and you know, that's that: astrologists, astrologists and aliens always use it.
People remember what they're found, don't know what they're found.
We note everything in science. We compare the number of the most visible and objective found.
So we've done this here.
We took two curves, one of which was an official registration of THC, and one left out.
And about 50 percent of the tests were successful. (Laughter) We're also taking this result at the grandfather.
This was a interesting, small example about what we do.
The "Skeptic" magazine is published for three months. It's a matter of each article."
This is about the coming of the weakness.
So when people go, they're going, or not?
And I'm going forward to me, I have some idea about this, and you can see that people are thinking when they go.
Every decade, the average IQ increases three numbers.
It's very interesting.
Don't think skepticism or scientific material.
Are science and religion harmonic?
It's what to ask the harmony of the health cabinet with science.
These are two different things.
It's not science education, it's activity.
It's hard to think about things.
Natural explanations for all the phenomenons are the way to accelerate.
"What's going to be more real? What's the way of the world's galaxies or the many-dimensional beings go away from the other galaxies, making the bond of Bob's box in Canada for the advertisement ""skeptic.com""?
"Well, one of the listeners of ""Skeptic"" would make it with ""Photoshop""?"
And then, the primary question (Laughter) is what definition is more real.
And before we say that something else is relevant to the world, we have to believe that it's not from this world.
"What's more real? Will Arnold be a cybernator? Or if the World Weekly News would go back to this?"
(Laughter) So things like this found their majority in Sydney Harris cartoon.
"I'm going to read for those in the archipelago: ""And then, there's a miracle."
"Well, you're going to explain the second pill better."" This slay devastates all the designs."
That's what this cartoon makes.
(Applause) You can tell you to start. But it doesn't explain anything. I don't make a idea.
There's nothing to do.
It's the end of the conversation for designers of the design.
In order to pay the opinions, scientists sometimes call extraordinary things as dark energy, dark matter. They call it to be called, until they understand what is.
It's the beginning of the mind window for science.
But for the design designers, it's the last part of the window.
And again, the same question comes. What's more real?
UFOs are the machine of asteroids, or is the gravity or the gravity?
It's a picture of UFO taken from my home in Altadena to Pasadena in California.
This doesn't read the box, right? Because it's a box.
"Well, ""Photoshop," high technology, computer doesn't need."
"I've taken this picture with the device ""code instamatic.""
Nobody got a patch on the hand outside.
The camera was ready — so much.
(Laughter) You can think some of them are real, if they're going to keep a lot of them or illusion, but the big chance is that they're all in the universe.
We're going to take more general, and we're always looking for a line between scientists and theory.
For example, there were two problems when the galaxies led the telescope to Saturn.
First, there was no theory about planetary galaxies.
Second, we've taken the witnesses, and we've taken them, so they didn't really understand what they saw.
"And he wrote his eyes like this: "I noticed that the distant planet was composed of three galaxies.""
He decided to see it.
So you can't form a good planetary reality with an unprecedented data theory without the theory.
This was so until 1655.
This is a page of the book that Christian Huygens has collected the dragonflies of the people who are going to deal with Saturn.
These two things were known to Huygens. There was a good theory about planetary galaxies and the solar system, and there was more precise telescope data, so we found that the Kepler rules went faster than Saturn.
And with this telescope, we could see the wall of the galaxies.
And that's that that's going to deepen the theory.
The poor part of the theory is that it can be full of science puzzles.
One of the reasons why people believe in the curiosity is that we only have and understand, and then I'm going to touch them for a serious reason.
We were eager to see it everywhere.
It's going on Mars.
In 1976, NASA wanted to take other images of the same place, and people thought that it was the mother that was created by marveles.
It's a picture that was taken closer in 2001.
If you go out of your eyes, you can go out of the face again.
When you're close your eyes, you turn the precise image into a more extraordinary image, so you're slowing down the quality of data.
And if I don't tell you have to look at the floor, you've seen the face because we've been able to recognize the face and the face.
The eyes are important for us from a social view.
And of course, they're smiling. It's easy to see all kinds of faces.
You can see a smile in Mars here.
(Laughter) If astronomers were in the structure, they would see the Kermiti in the Qur'an.
Look. Have you ever seen the dragonflies of the ball?
Or if the geologists were flying.
Religious icons.
(Laughter) In 1996, he found a crater in Tennessee.
He took five dollars from those who wanted to see a rap to see a rap. That's the fact that Rahiba was going to be alert about the origins of Terez.
Here's Guadalupe and Watsonville, down, down. Is it small?
It's very suitable for this work, because there's rains, rains, rains, and it's like you see these images on the surface — people's grains of images.
It's a look at the outside of the window in Sao Paulo.
Here, I'm going to show the surface in the peninsula, and I'm going to touch it on the casino in Las Vegas. Yes, here's America.
(Laughter) The casino paid 28 500 dollars to buy this sendow from eBay. (Laughter)
So what's what you're going to read? (Laughter)
They've been embedded, and it's a place in the door of the 1940s.
I'm going to look at Clearwater in Florida.
I went to me to see it.
There was a lot of people.
It's a very faithful person who comes with real cars, with the dragonflies trees.
And we've been interested closer.
So so you can see the dimension — this was the image of Dawkins, I and my wonderful Randi, which was high for two, two and a half-dimensional floor.
In my sense of respect, thousands of people ran out.
And we went to look at the point to understand what they've done.
You don't say, there's a picture in places with fontan and palm trees.
And that's the picture of the Look at the other side. They started to look at.
However, most of one thousand can be a miracle.
(Laughter) Here's really a magic of Marge, not a Marge magic? (Laughter)
And I'm going to take another example about this, and I'm going to finish my head with this sort of illusion.
There's a film called ""Laughter,"" and Maykl Kiton is playing, and the dead tells us to talk to us."
And when you come to the world, talking to the dead, it's not really a lot of difference.
It seems that everyone can talk.
It's the answer of the dead that's hard.
(Laughter) In this movie, these messages are hidden in electronic events.
I upload them from a website called ReverseSpeech.com.
It's the most famous.
It's the new sound of that famous audience.
(Laughter) If you're older, don't worry.
May Kenyan's writing is clean.
And if two ways are separate, it's time to change the way.
Now, call it. Look at this word, you can hear a secret message in this word?
(Music and unprecedented words) [Satan] — Satan
(Music and unprecedented words) What did you hear? Recorder: The Devil!
Satan? You can't hear the least satan.
Now I'm going to say what you need to hear to listen to your brain, and we'll hear again.
I'm going to finish my nit with a little, beautiful and meaningful story.
""Skeptics"" is an extra-profit institution."
We're always looking for good things that people are doing.
There's a pop museum in England.
Now he's very popular in England: he's called Katie Melu.
There's a very beautiful universe.
"It was one of the best five places in 2005, called ""50 million bicycles in the village."" It's a love story — Norah Jones's account of Britain. His beloved son is the right of him to love about twenty million bicycles."
There's a part of these words.
(Music) We've been 12 billion lightwater away from the universe. It's the galaxy. Nobody can say that's right. But I can say that I'm going to live for you.
Spiker: Yes. It's at least a close number.
"In America, this would be ""We've been six thousand light water away from the sky."" (Laughter) My friend Simon Singh, a gravitational physicist. It's now a scientific piece, and it's the creator of the book ""The Great Partition."" It's worth all the opportunity to promote good science."
"So, in the Guardian, he wrote a story about the story of Katie, and he said, we know exactly how much we're going to go away from it."
We were 12 not, 13,7 billion lightwater away, and it's not true.
And if we're likely to have little damage, we know exactly how much it's.
So, if we're not completely correct, we can say that it's very close to the correct number.
The surprise is that after the publication of his article, Katie asked him, and he said, I was very hateful, I was a member of the astronomical club.
I didn't have to keep the way. He wrote the story.
And I'm going to end my mind with that.
(Music words) We've been 13,7 billion lightwater away from the border of the universe that we can be a customer.
It can be a real advantage, but it's the nearest amount that is accurate.
And in terms of the data in our hands, I'm so expected that I'll always be together with you.
(Laughter) Well, right?
(Applause)
In the 1980s, if you have a written machine in East Germany, you have to take it from registration.
The example of a text that was written in the machine had to go from registration.
So the government knew the source of all the books.
When they found a paper that invented a thought, they could find the writer of this thought.
And we've calculated that thing in the West as unprecedented, as a great damage to freedom of expression.
We don't have ever allowed it in our country.
But today, in 2011, when you take a laser pressure device of any famous mark, you're going to print everything on each page, the yellow points that are only in your printer, and that's going to differentiate from others, will be transmitted automatically.
This is the reality of today.
Nobody doesn't put it into a lot.
This is an example of our government's technology that uses us to our own citizens.
This is one of three major online problems.
And when we look at online problems, we see online attacks that are carried out by certain groups.
These attackers are divided into three major groups.
First, they're online criminals.
So, in this way, as Dmitri Kolubov, who is from Kiyev city of Ukraine.
And it's not very difficult to understand why online criminals are going to lose crime.
These people get money.
So very much, actually, they're going to get a lot of money on the world.
In fact, we've seen millions of people who are multi-millioners with online attacks.
It's Vladimir Tsasts from the city of Tartu in Estonia.
This is Alfred Gonzalez.
That's Stephen Watt.
This is Bjorn Sundin.
This is Matthew Anderson and Tariq Al-Daour. It's also going to extend the black.
These people earn their services online, but they're doing this by an extraordinary way, and when we operate online, they use things like a banking virus, or when we buy a virus, they collect our credit card data with the key reader software when we're buying online.
Two months ago, the U.S. secret service organ gave the account of a person named Sam Jain, who was in the Swedish bank, who had 14,9 million US dollars.
But nobody knows that Sam Je's wall.
I think today, we're more likely to be victims of crime in the world than actually.
And it seems clearly that when the situation goes, it's getting worse.
When it comes, the big universe of crimes will start online.
The second big group of online attackers don't have the reason to take this job.
The reasons why they're trying to see this could be violence, freedom of thought, smile.
Groups like Anonymous have grown in the last year, and they have started to place on the basis of global attacks.
I calculated two of the three major attackers: these are criminals who work for the police, such as Anonymous, who are hackers for protest. The third major force is government and government.
Let's look at those who start in companies like DigiNotar.
It's a simple example of what governments are doing when they attack their citizens.
DigiNotar is a certificate found in Holland — more precisely — that's that.
In our previous year, they've been released from the world's cancer.
Nobody went into the system and all the system broke out.
And I asked the Dutch government leaders in a refugee last week, and I felt that I didn't believe that one of the ministers of the State was the cause of the human death of DigiNotar.
He said he believed.
Why are people dying by such an attack?
DigiNotar is the online certificate Association.
They sell online certificate.
What do they do with certificates?
If you have a website based on HTTPS, and if you want to use the SSL encryption service, you need this certificate.
We use a lot of the Gmail or the reader services, but it's more popular in countries that have the totalitary regime like Iran, but in these countries, the leaders use more than the foreign services like Gmail, because they don't have to control the government emails as a SSL encryption.
But it's not a foreign certificate that offers such services.
It's possible by distribuing the page of the companies.
And that was what happened to the DigiNotar company.
How are the Arab Bahreins and what happens in Miseria?
In the mission, in April 2011, the prisoners ran out the center of the Secret Police of Mission, and they took a lot of document that wanted to look at it.
"In these papers, there was a file called ""FINFISHER."" And in this file, there were records of a company that was in Germany. The company bought tools and apps to the government of Mission to keep citizens all of their means of communication under control."
These tools were sold to the Misir government to 280,000 euros.
The center of the company is all here.
In fact, the Western governments provide it with devices that allow the totalitary governments to keep their citizens under control.
But the Western governments do this for their own citizens.
For example, a few weeks ago, there was a virus that called the State Virus in Germany, which was created for three to control his citizens by the German government.
If you're guilty of a little bit of gravity, it's obvious that your phone is heard.
Now, it's too long.
They will look forward to your Internet connection.
The government virus can control all your relationships through your computer, listen to your online conversations, they can learn your numbers.
"It's a lot of people who talk about things like this, and they're able to answer, ""Laughter, it's not a good job, but I'm a national who has a blood, don't have a lot of impression for me."
Why do I worry about it?
"I don't have anything crazy."" But it's a very crazy idea."
The privacy is a condition.
It's not about music.
This doesn't matter the choice between security and nature.
It's based on the choice between freedom and supervision.
And that's what we believe in our government today in 2011, and what we're able to reject our law.
But can we believe in our future, the next 50 years of the government, about the future?
And so questions and questions should have to worry about us in the next 50 years.
(Music) (Applause) Thank you because you're here.
"And I say, ""Thank you for you that's here,"" because I was in a cave for 17 years."
And I told me that these first things were the 20th anniversary of the Earth World in Washington DC.
My family and my friends were hit to listen to me.
"I said, ""I'm going to remember because you're here,"" And my mother said, ""He speaks to Hallley, Johnny.""
(Laughter) Imagine what you're in a cave for 17 years, and imagine your mother's nature of life.
"My father said to me, ""It's the only."" I'm going to understand it."
I looked forward because I didn't know what my voice came from the front.
"I didn't hear my voice for 17 years, and I looked around me and said, "Oh, God, who is what I think?""
And then I realized that this is my self and my smile.
"And my father said, ""Yes, he's going to go out."" Now I want to bring you to this journey."
But despite the exception of this life, it's all of us.
I believe you can be a metafor for our lives, and I want you to never think about your own journey.
My journey started in 1971, when I was witnessing the collision of two oil tankers under Golden Gate, then a half million galaxies were destroyed by the wind of oil.
It affected me so much that I decided to not use mechanical transport tools.
This is a big thing for California.
This was also a big thing to take the small Point Reyes station that I lived in Inverness, and there were 350 people who lived at the beginning of 71 years.
And when I came here, I started to go to the ped, people — they knew what happened.
"They went to me and asked me, ""John, what do you?"" I said, ""I'm going to go to a pit for a poor environment,"" they said, ""Well, you're doing that to hate us, right?"
"You're doing that to do us not yet bad."" Maybe they were true, I thought people would join me when I walked on the foot."
Because it's all of the oil that's in the ocean.
He spoke, and I was talking about people who didn't stop with this season.
I asked my parents.
"And I said, ""I don't use more than a car."" My father said, ""Why didn't you do this when you were 16 years old?"" (Laughter) I didn't know about the environment at that time."
They lived in Philadelphia.
"And I said to my mother, ""I'm very happy, I'm very happy."" And he said, ""If you don't want to tell it, you don't have to tell it."" Any mothers are so."
So, at my 27th birthday, I decided that — because I had a lot of disputes, and I talked very much — I decided that I would give me a single day, a day, a day.
So I did that.
And I didn't tell you anything when I went out of the morning.
And I say that this was a wonderful experience for me because I started to hear for the first time so long.
And what I heard was motivated to think of me.
Because I always thought I would hear people, and when I listened to people, I would believe that they would want to talk about what they want to say, I didn't hear them anymore.
And when I was talking to people, I went forward to them, and I thought about what they're going to say.
And then ...
So the community ended.
And that day I really heard.
And this was a question for me because I realized I didn't learn something in these years.
I was 27 years old and I thought I knew everything.
But I didn't know.
So I studied it for the next day, then again and this time, and I said to me that I'd be in a year, because I started to learn, and I needed it.
So I didn't talk for a year, and then I thought in my day that I might begin to talk again about some things I learned.
But this time took 17 years.
I went to the table for 17 years, and I worked on the bank, and I worked on writing my story and my day. I tried to study the entire engineering book.
And I thought I needed to get education.
I went to Ashland, Oregon, and they had education programs on the environment there.
800 kilometers away.
I went to the award office, and what? What?
I've shown the office in the magazine.
Oh, you want to read here when you're born?
Have you ever heard?
We have a special program for you. They've done it.
And two years later, I ended up with the rate of breeding.
My father came. He gave me a gift.
"He said, ""Laughter, my son, we don't give you, but we don't know what to do with this graduate degree."
"You're not driving the car, you don't talk, you don't do it."" (Laughter) I put my flower, I took my white box and I started to go back."
I went to Port Townsend, Washington, and I got back here from the wood, and I moved it through Puget Sound from Idaho to Washington, and there I moved to Missoula, Montana.
Two years ago, I invited the University of Montana, and I wanted that.
It wasn't bad to stay here for two years.
(Laughter) And so that happened. I've been studying at the University for two years. The soldiers gave me a lot of help.
There's two stories about Montana.
The first thing is that when we arrived, my pulse was lost.
"And they said, ""Don't worry about it."" The program manager said, ""Go back in the morning,"" He gave me 150 dollars, and he said, ""Go for a lesson."
"Do you go to South America, Hell?"" I said to him — Stars and stars, hydrogen systems, South America."
So I did that.
"He came back and said to me, ""Ok, John, you can use the book as a student, taking the office open for a lesson.
But we're going to allow you to take all the teachers to participate in their classroom.
"Let's be easy to take a lot of money, and the rest of the matter, and then you can take a lot of money."" Yeah, I don't have these tests in the magistrat."
They wanted to help me, and I wanted to help me.
They saw that there's a lot of things in the environment, and they tried to help me in this way.
And in this period, I've been able to talk.
I had 13 students when I went to school for the first time.
And my friend translated them to my hand signatures: the name is John Francis, I go to piano, I told them that it's not going to be more translated — that's the last lesson.
All of the students who are going to do this.
(Laughter) I've seen the winds of time to go away.
But I had to tell them that picture.
Two weeks later, everyone tried to go into our village.
I've learned a lot of things in this school, when I've done these things.
And he got all of his head to say what John works to say — I don't know, I think it's going to break the trees. Yes, it's going to break the trees.
No, no. It's not that — it's the use of this hand machine.
You're someone with a hand movement.
You can actually do someone.
It doesn't talk about the selection engineering.
So this was a sign of discussion, and we talked about it.
I've taken back to this job and say, I've gone away.
But what I learned was something. When we showed a rare sign, they called the sense that I didn't fully look at, but I didn't even look at it.
And I thought that if you don't learn and learn, and if you don't learn yourself, you don't learn well.
So I continued.
"And my father came to my father and my father said to me and my father, ""We're giving you, but you know."" And I said, ""You're going to drive and talk to a car."
"What are you going to do with the Master Diploma?"" I took my Chinese, went to my cabinet and went to the University of Wisconsin."
And I went there for two years, writing about oil tolls.
Nobody wasn't interested in oil carriers.
But something happened — Exxon Valdez.
And I was a man who wrote about oil tolls in the U.S.
My father came again.
"He said, ""My son doesn't know how they do, ""You don't use the machine, you don't talk."
"My father said, ""You need to leave you out, because you're going to make better things."" (Laughter) I got my box back to me."
I took my bath, and I went to the east coast, and I took my feet to the Atlantic Ocean, and I took seven years and a day to go on it from the beginning of the United States.
And in 1990, I started to put Earth Earth in the 20th century of the Sun.
That's why I've done these things because there's no voice that you don't hear when the trees are falling on the floor.
And I thank the soldiers and the family because they came to hear me.
And that's a community.
And they taught me to hear — they heard me.
And that's something that doesn't come from that hole — listening to each other.
It's really important — we need to listen to each other.
My journey continued.
"My father said, ""It's the only."" And I didn't endeavor it."
I've worked as a Sahil Guard, I've been a wonderful leader of the U.S.
I wrote rules for the U.S. — rules for oil tolls.
"20 years ago, if someone said to me, "John, you want to do a separation from birth?""
"Yes, I want to be individual."
"And they would say, ""Come to my right place, go out of the car and start to my right place."" And then they said, ""Well, you eat it."" (Laughter) My friend, you want to be individual.""
How does this happen? Why?
How can we be different with simple things like to go to the market and not talk?
It's a wonderful time of the Sahil Guard.
"And then, — I worked here for just a year — I said, ""Well, it's a year for me to do this."" I took a great return, and I went to the Gulf of the Caribbean until I went to Venezuela, and I went to all the numbers of the army."
The key thing came out — I'm going to tell you why I started to talk to you.
I started to talk, I started to learn about the cloud engineering.
I've learned about the environment in this level — formally, but there was an extra-formal science.
And the non-formal science — that was what I learned about people, what we do and we're crazy.
And the environment does not only change because of trees and birds, but not for the species that are dangerous, but for our respect to each other.
And if we look at the environment, we look at all around us and see our behavior against ourselves and each other.
And that was the inventor that I wanted to transmit.
"And I said, ""I'm going to transmit this inventor to others," and I've been sitting in the middle of the Caribbean — that was my own source, and I worked on it — I went to Venezuela and I started to go."
It's the end of this story, and I realized that I didn't go there because I didn't use the car.
I went through El Dorado — here's a famous prison city, or a Russian prison prison — in Venezuela, and I don't know what happened to me because I didn't know in myself.
"And when he went through the security gate, he took me and said, ""Applause, passport"" and M16 he ran me down."
"And I said, ""passport?"
I'm not going to show you a pass, but it's my box.
I went through the world, and I left the rate of the U.S. — Dr. Francis and I left the world.
What did I mean to say that?
And the way came back to prison.
They didn't smile me.
So I was free, and I thank God because I was free. What do I say?
After we went 150 kilometers on the road, I realized that I was turned into my dream, and I was turned into my hobby.
I was in prison and I had to leave it.
I didn't use technical transport tools was a prison that I was inside.
What would happen?
Because when I started, he looked like I was able to use the car.
But the difference was that I wanted to look at myself every day, but I didn't want to use my feet.
I'm not going to go to the U.S. Gulf.
I didn't come to be a teacher.
And so I realized that I had only other responsibilities than myself, and so I had to change.
You know, we can do it.
I was going to change.
And I was afraid of change because I've always learned to go and go.
Because I learned to a prison who didn't want the end.
I didn't know who I would be when I walk.
But I knew that was necessary.
I knew that I didn't change, because this was the way to be here today.
And I know that we're looking at a lot of time where we want to stay forever, but there are other places to go for us.
And we don't go to the place where we have a new person, and we have the stability of our person we have now, and we don't go back to the place we have a new person.
And I want to thank you to go to this next place — take you to the place where you can go from the prison you see inside, that is so comfortable as possible. We should do something today.
We don't change.
We have to be happy as our previous President of Vitse said.
And if my voice affects you, if my life affects you, I'm asking you to do that if I'm here, if I'm affected you.
I know that when I'm here, you can all impact me.
Let's come to the world — take this source, take this love, take this respect with us — here, the opportunity we show to each other at TED when we're coming to the world with ourselves.
Because we're the environment engineer and our mutual behavior means our behavior in our environment.
So, because I'm here, I'm going to remind you, and I'm going to finish my journey for five seconds.
Thank you.
(Applause)
"Well, if you rely on any small scale in America, a plant gets closer to you and asks, " Look, what's the name of this block?""
"And you say, ""It's a little Oak, it's a little science.""
"It's 26th, but he's 27th."" He says, ""Well, what's the name of this block?"" You say, ""The block doesn't be called."
"They have the names of kids, the blocks are just an unprecedented government between little ones."" He's looking for you in a little crazy and embarrassing."
"So we're going to imagine that if you're a little bit in Japan, you're sitting around my name, you're going to tell me, "Well, what's the name of this little?""
"He says, ""This block is 17 and the number of that block is 16,"" And you say, ""What's the name of this small thing?"" He says, ""They don't have the names of the kids."
The blocks are called.
Look at Google Maps. There are 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 blocks.
All of these blocks are called. The little ones are an unprecedented government between the blocks.
"And you say, ""Well, how do you design your home name?"" He says, ""It's very easy. This is the eighth ray."
"And if you're asked again the block 17 and the room number 1, ""Laughter. I'm looking at him, ""I'm not going to go with the house's names."" He says, ""Well, they're going to go. They're going to be invisible in the history."
The number of the first house in the block is one.
And then, the number of the second is two.
"It's a fan. It's just a single and a single."" And sometimes I'm going to go to one of the world to see that most of us don't have to think of what we don't think is right to understand."
For example, students in China think that their job is to keep you safe.
In the months you're grateful, you pay a pension to students, and if you're sick, you don't pay a pension, because they don't go out of their work. They't have time when you're safe, because you're sick.
"Applause, in many music, we calculate that we start to a ""een"" music. One, two, three."
"The Amma in Western Africa shows that there's no bit of a musical part, like the point that's the end of a phrase."
So you see it not just when you share it in particles, but also when you see it. Two, three, four, one.
And this map is true.
It's a smile that I'm saying that what you know about India is true.
So never forget how you're thinking about TED or any other places, or if you're listening, it can be right.
Domo arigato gozaimashita. ( Thank you. Japan)
