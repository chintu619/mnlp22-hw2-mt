I'm going to talk about unexpected scientists today.
I'm working in solar technology industry.
And my little beginning point is to bring us into force, and that's that.
... So we look at different sources for that.
It's just a little video about what we do.
Yes, a minute.
It can happen a little bit of time.
(Laughter) We're just going to pass this part — I'm going to pass over the part of the video. (Laughter)
No. (Laughter) (Laughter)
(Music) It's not ... (Laughter)
Well. (Laughter)
Sun technology.
Oh, was my time gone?
Well. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So I want to look at what you do.
We're going to return to this for a few minutes later. I hope that if you learn to control your body very little, it will change your life very much.
We're very interested in what we're speaking, especially what others look at.
There are different places that concern us: (Laughter) whether it's unconscious or smile, an unbelievable look or an unbelievable expectation, or even a simple thing like irritation of the hand.
One thought: Now they're going to go to a 10-year-old house.
That's a chance police that takes the hands of the President of the U.S.
We're able. We're collecting ourselves.
We're crazy.
We're trying to be invisible for someone around us.
As you see, animals and people do the same things.
And when we're confronted with courage and courage, we're confronted with this.
And when we've got sure, we've actually been able to complete the rest of others.
So if someone uses power against us, we're trying to collect. We don't exceed his gravity.
In fact, we're going to look at his power.
I saw that MBA students show a lot of power levels.
Some of them put themselves as a leader, and when they go to the school room, they go in the right middle of the galaxy, they're still going to go to their place when they're not going to study.
There's a little bit of two people where they go.
They raise them in this way.
I've done a few results for myself.
First, imagine you that it's not going to be puzzled.
It's calculated that it's dependent on the gravity.
So women depend more of this blood than men.
Women usually feel weak than men, and it's not surprising.
And this is very important for students of MBA, because it affects the prices of education.
Business schools are always fighting gender difference.
People and women, who are made at the same level, take different prices at the end of the course, and it seems to depend on the activity.
I started to think about myself, and we're going to see that they're more active in the classroom that they come in this way.
So if they show these videos, if they want themselves to take this kind of art, they're going to be more active in the classroom?
So if we show ourselves strong for a short time, can we feel stronger as a result of the change of our behavior?
Now, we know that our ocean and physics defines thinking and part of others about us, and there's a lot of dimensions.
But the question that really affects us is that we don't have impact on ourselves.
Well, that's real in both ways.
It's also about force.
And when we feel strong and credible, we're going to be fruit of a more powerful way, but when we're trying to be strong, we feel strong.
What do I mean when I say, when I think about power?
I talk about thinking and particles, and about physiological things that form them, and for me, they're these hormones. I'm learning hormones.
What does it differentiate the minds of weak and weak?
But only 60 percent of those in the power position, that's a very important difference.
And that's what we've discovered in testosterone.
As I went out, I grew up with 20% of the testosterone of those who passed from the experience of force, and in others, there was a 10% reduction.
There's two minutes to do these changes.
But those in the cortizol are these:
It's about 25 percent of those in the body of force, and in others, it's about 15 percent higher.
Almost two minutes, these harmonic changes accelerate our brain to feel stronger, comfortable, or stressed and hot.
These particles are familiar with us all, right?
Well, what our language defines how we can think and feel about ourselves, so it's not only for others.
And that's another thing that can change our thinking.
And the next question that we're interested is that we're going to change our life that we're going to take a few minutes of force.
This is a two-minute experiment that started in the laboratory.
How can we implement it in real life?
Of course, this is what's important for us.
In fact, these places can be used to be used to calculate the situation that creates a social threat.
Are we actually calculated on the floor?
This is the back of the food table for new things.
This is a school meeting for some.
It's a call for others, or it's a job interview.
We thought that many of you're interested in a product interview because it's a lot of you's a experience.
So we published our findings, media interviewed them, and what the jusrnalists said, "Do we do this when we go to a job interview?"
(Laughter) Of course, we rejected this idea. No! Of course, we didn't see it.
You don't do this.
It's not with your other people.
Your relationship with yourself is three.
What do you do before you start an interview?
You're sitting. You look at iPhone or Android.
You look at your predictions, look forward, pick up yourself, and actually see what you need to do is that, like you're sitting on the foot. Look at the same point.
This was what we wanted to do.
When they went to the laboratory, they went to a very hard work interview after we had re-power and power points.
Five minutes of interview was taken into a video.
They were taught to use them by an extra-verbal tool to prevent the effects of those who calculated the interest. They looked like this.
It's easier to look at an emotional eye for five minutes than to keep the question.
Nobody doesn't like it.
Marian LaFrance calls it to stay in social battle. It increases the level of cortizol in this person.
We took them from a interview to see some of them.
And then we've shown four of these images to coders.
They were not aware of our expectations.
They didn't know what they took. After we looked at the video, they showed people who had a high power position, saying, "We want to take them."
"We don't want to take them to work.
"And the ancestors are more positive."" What does this effect?"
It's not because of their nature.
It's because they're connected to their nets.
And we looked at their other indicators, for example, how much are the numbers wrong?
What are the benefits?
There was no difference for these indicators.
That's not what's a major impact.
People just show their real faces.
So they show themselves.
You don't imagine their ideas, they show themselves.
It's really affected by this factor.
"And when I say to people, what we think, what we think, what we think, and what we can change our consequences, they say, ""Is it not a little bit?"" So I."
I'm going to say you're imitation until you reach the reality.
"""I'm not so."
I don't want to realize anything and feel cool.
I don't want to be a fraudule.
"I don't want to be where I'm invisible.""
"I'm going to understand these words very well. I'm going to tell you a little story about the feeling of ""I'm not my place.""
When I was 19 years old, I had a very severe car crash.
It's taken into a golf of a vehicle.
I turned out there a few times.
I played in the rehabilitation department, I had to leave the college, and I told me that I was down to the point 2 of the IQ rate, which was very painful for me.
I've made my IQ because I've been recognized as a kid who was unconscious and unwanted.
I tried to return because I was released from college.
They said to me, "You don't have to finish college.
"It's a lot of things you can eat, but it's not a college industry,"" they said, I've started to fight, and I've started to say, that your key feature that you have was, because I've been anxious, nothing can weak you as you get from your hand."
I felt very weak.
I worked, I worked, I worked on my own mind, and I won a lot of success.
So I got a college.
"I had to spend my group friends for four years, and I decided that Susan Fiskeni, who was a teacher, agreed to accept me to the University of Winston. So I thought, ""I don't have any place.""
I've been in prison.
I'm going to take the first 20 minutes of my first course that 20 people heard in Princeton.
It was the first night.
I was so worried about the opening of the morning that he asked my leader, "I don't know it."" He said to me, "No, if you're going to do, I'd come in your bar.
It's waiting for you to stay and tell me.
But if you're in the box.
You're going to take all the results you need.
Again, again, if you're afraid, and you're going to be anxious, if you don't listen to you, "It's not done. I'm going to look at!
"You're really coming from my hand."" You're going to work until you're going to say."" I've done that."
For five years, I'm reading the high pill of the school. For a few years, I'm going to Northwest, I'm moved to Harvard, and I'm working there. Now I don't think about that, but for a long time I thought, ""I'm not my place."
And at the end of the first year I was in Harvard, I didn't talk to my cabinet once in a semester, saying, "You're not going to work, or you're going to break."" I didn't know it well.
He went into the inside in a completely troubled situation, and he said, "Now I'm not my place."
That's the point of return for me.
Because two things happened.
First, I realized that I didn't go beyond that sense.
But he felt, and those particles were familiar with me.
And the second thing, I thought he was in the right place.
So he could look at it by imitation.
And I said to him, "Hey, here's the whole thing.
"He said that he would show himself as he went out, he will show himself strong, and you will come into the school room, and you're going to go to the best partnership that he was given today."" He said, he didn't have to do this. She didn't know that she was here, and she didn't stand here. (Laughter) A few months later, he came to me and I saw that he came to his grandmother, and she didn't feel true, but she didn't imagine it until he was actually."
He changed.
I would like to tell you that,
Imagine it until we're real.
So show yourself so much as you want to be one.
You want to know that,
The physical corrections can bring these big changes.
Now, I've told it for two minutes.
Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.
Try to do this for two minutes before you're going to calculate the number of times, in the lift, in the room, back of the table or back of the connected gate.
Take what you want to do.
Look at that your brain will have the best thing of the situation.
Add your testosterone. But reduce your corticol.
"Oh, I don't show them what I can."" So don't allow you to be able to stop with persecution."
"Laughter, ""I'm going to come to them and show them."""
So I want to share it with others, like you to implement this force, because it's very simple.
It's not self-conciliation. (Laughter) You publish this teaching and share this with people, because people who can do this, are generally people who have no technology and resources, no status and no confidence.
And share it with them that people can use.
Because only two minutes of attention to the body can have a significant impact on their life.
Thank you.
(Applause).
We have a lot of prisoners in the world.
The most of them in the supergles is invisible.
As the catators, they're the workers who collect material that they've returned to live.
They're doing a hard, honest and necessary job that helps everyone. But they don't thank them for that.
Here, in Brazil, 90 percent of the products that will be returned — what they collect.
Most of the galaxies work public. They're going to go from birds, and they're going to go back to the center of galaxies.
Karrocs remember cars or cars that are made of metal from a little bit of Brazilians, or from a few little bit of art.
And that's why I'm familiar with the super-creats that I've created.
I'm a powerful leader and activist. My works are about protecting social, political and environmental.
In 2007, I turned my job from dragonflies to dragonflies to dragonflies to support the city's life.
But this time I supported the catators.
And I've taken more attention to my work, to the art and the egg, and it helped them to focus on these catators and to increase their confidence.
They're famous today in the media and social media.
In fact, I've always worked for this time when I'm familiar with this world.
I got more than 200 cars in many cities, and I invited a lot of travelers and travelers in the world.
I felt that the cataders with invisible things don't only belong to Brazil.
I found them in Argentina, Chile, South Africa, Turkey, even in countries that evolved like Japan and the United States.
And then, I realized that more people should be involved in this matter, because it was a big job.
"And then, I created a cluster under the head of ""Laughter my car"" (Pimp My Carroza). (Laughter) It's a cluster that can be funded by the people."
Thank you.
(Applause)
"It was a great challenge for the people who were created to help the catators and the carrocks, ""Be beautiful.""
They supported students, dentisters, kids, hairstylists, mass therapists, and so well-known professionals and health services.
In addition, when the quarks were built by our colonists, they were given them to look good to the protective stars, the beach that didn't rain, and the city.
They also took other tools for security: essential lentles, patterns and vibrations.
Finally, they've become part of this wonderful and great ship ship.
"""Be beautiful."" He went to Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Kuwait.
"And we've created a Pimpx version that is facilitated by the people who's outside Brazil, and that is inspired by TEDx to combine their students, which is a simple version of the Pimpx, which is created by the people, created by the public."
So it would be able to join all.
"In two years, 170 katadors, 800 volunteers and 200 young people, and over 1,000 donors have been involved in the cluster of ""Laughter of Carrocha."" And they have been trained to re-educate in local schools with their help."
Now, the galaxies were people who were honorable and worthy of value when they left invisible.
They're able to deal with wonderful ideas because they're wonderful, they could increase their income and their relationship with society.
Now, I invite you to find the catators in your city and other invisible super heroes and to recognize them.
Try to see the world as a whole without limits and fluids.
If you want to believe, there are more than 20 million galaxies in the world.
So when you see someone next, know them as a part of our life.
So much orbigado, thank you.
(Applause)
On 5 November 1990, a person called Al-Saiid Nosair went to a hotel in Manhattan and went to Ravvin Meir Kahane, the leader of the Jewish Defense League.
He was unbelievable when Nosair was arrested, but when he was charged with gravity, he made a number of the governments of New York with other criminals — the tunels, the prisoners and the U.S. headquarters.
Fortunately, plans were underfinished by a FTB officer.
But unfortunately, in 1993, he didn't stand to prevent the bombing of the World Heritage Institute.
And finally, Nosair could be troubled by each other.
My father is the hands-Sayide Nosair.
In 1983, in Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, I was looking forward to the world as a child of a poor engineer and a compassionate American teacher of education. They didn't want to go to me to live a happy childhood.
After my seven years of age, my family started to change our relationship.
My father caused me to see that many Muslims, including many Muslims, are very few people who are a witness.
But from my life experience, I learned this: people don't have a long time to understand that the expectations of each other are the same than the life.
And in every world, there's a few people who can feel that they're suffering against their faith in every world, and that they want others to drive their lives.
For a few months ago, my father went to me and told me that we went to police training in London with friends in the last few weeks.
But I told me that I would go with him in the morning.
We came to the Calverton Flight Police, and then we didn't know that there was a FTB's secret observer.
When my father came to me, my father helped me to keep my body in my flower, and he realized how to do 30 meters.
That's the last voice that I've taken on that day, which came down to a small rains lamp on the nectar, and it's a rains, and I've been surprised at it, especially.
And I went to other people and said, "Ibn Abuh" — from Arabic, "It's the piece of his father."
All of the words that said laughed, but a few years later, I realized what they're really smiling.
They thought that my father was powerful, and that's terrible in me.
Lastly, these people were worried about the death of six people and the death of more than 1,000 people and the death of the Earth's Department of Agriculture, which was filled with 700 kg of particles.
And these people would take me a book, and I'm going to take me.
"I'm OK."" They were people I called mother.
We changed our lives 20 times as I was 19 years old, and this change caused my friends to have little time during my childhood.
It was one of us that we didn't feel close to me, and we didn't move to other cities.
As a new one, I've always turned to the goal of the kids that you're going to do.
I kept my person secret from my school colleagues to stay in the center of the center, but it was so clear that the new student was enough to have the most string and top of the universe.
That's why I've read a lot of my time in my house, watching TV or playing a game.
So I had conflicts with the ability of social community, and I didn't have been prepared for the right hand of life as a fanatic family.
And I grew up in a environment that was justified because I was aware of people like religion and religion.
What happened to open my eyes?
One of my first experience that leads me to this way of thinking was the time of the President's election in 2000.
I've taken the commitment to participate in the National Children's Convention in Filadelf under the program of preparation for the university.
And the group I thought was going to fight violence among young people, and I was not going to fight the violence of the children who had a lot of their lives.
The part of our group was people who had different ways of life.
I learned that one of the kids I was Jewish in the last days of the convention.
This fact was only discovered for a few days, but sometimes I wanted to understand that there's no conflict between us.
He had never been my Jewish friend before, and I said that I had a kind of compassion because I was aware of the barries that I had never taken me for the whole life.
But a more important point of return was the job I found to get extra profit in the busch Garden's recreation park.
I was in the center of people with different religions and cultures, and I played a fundamental role in the creation of this experience.
I learned that a large part of my life was homosexuality's fault, and in general, that all of my genes have a sense of sense.
The job was that I had the opportunity to work with gay artists in one of the dimensions, while many of them were the best and the least fruitful people that I saw to show them.
I discovered. It's a sense that I've formed in me, like someone who was very familiar with the time, like someone who was very familiar with others, and I've learned that I don't want to do something that I don't want to do with myself.
I've been able to compare stereotypes that I learned from my childhood with a proper life experience.
I'm unknowable how it's heard of being gay, but I'm very well familiar with what it's happening because it doesn't depend on you.
"And then, ""The Daily Show."" Con Stüart helped me to be honest with myself about my respect for fanalism, and he helped me to understand that human moral, religious and sexual orientation are not related to his nature."
Con Stüart, in the moment I needed my father, had put me into the real sense of the word.
The inspiration comes from a very unexpected country, and the fact that the Jewish comedian had more positive impact on my world's view than my extreme father was not going to me.
One day, my mother and my mother was compassionate about the change of my world perspective, and my mother told me a word that I couldn't get out of my heart for my lifetime.
My mother looked at me with the eyes of fatigue, as a person who lived enough cosmistic throughout his life, and he said, "I was scared to hate men."
I realized how intelligent it requires energy to tell the sense of hat in one morning.
That's not my right step.
I changed my name when I decided to start a new life with my father.
So why did I put myself in danger?
It's very simple.
And I hope that, sometimes, someone who comes to violence has heard my story, and I'm not fanatic, though I didn't get involved with an intolerant ideology.
In fact, I decided to use my life experience as a fight against terrorism and fanalism.
This is the name of terror victims and their loved ones, the terrible suffering and the destruction that terrorism has lived for them.
I'm going to contest my father's actions because of terror victims, and I'm not going to stop in this kind of extraordinary activity.
As a simple example of my advisors, I'm a real challenge to have no obligation to believe violence and go through the way of his son's father.
I'm not like my father.
Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you all. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
It's good morning.
Are we sure?
They took a step on them, but I wanted to ask you. Who wrote the name on his marriage in Arabic?
Nobody wrote? Who? Well, there's no problem.
One day ago, I was sitting with my friend in a restaurant, and I buy food.
"I looked at the office, and I said, ""Are you a woman? (Laughter)"
He looked surprised at me, thinking he heard the word wrong.
"He said, ""Applause? (In English)"" I said, ""Laughter is not guilty."" He said, ""You don't know what they say to him?"" "I know.""
"He said, ""No! It's called him a menu or a menu."" What's my French requirement?"
"Well, let's work with this!"" He said to the office."
"He was angry with me. He said to himself, "If he was the most cool girl in this world, I didn't look at him.""
What's the meaning of saying ""Menu"" in Arabic?
And this was two words, and the little boy of Lion, who was still in the front of the village, was not ignorant.
How could he talk like this?
And then I started to think.
And that's why I'm going to do.
It's really worth the dragonflies of the man.
They don't accept me because they talk me in my country.
Can it start on another side?
How did we fall here?
But when we're here, there are many people here like me that they're going to take a stage in their lives that they're not only the unprecedented thing they're going to be modern and political to do with them.
Should I forget my whole culture, my ideas, my mind and my love?
Children's love about war could be our best love.
I've learned Arabic to adapt everything.
Should I forget to be one of them?
Have you ever been here?
And despite all these things, I tried to deal with him.
I didn't want to judge him with the surprise that he made me justice.
Arabic doesn't respond to the demands of this day.
It's not the language of science, research, or it's not the language that we're confident to present a large-scale research project that we're habituated at our universities. And it's not the language we use in our airports.
If we would do this, they would put our shoes.
How should I use my language? We should all give this water!
You want to use Arabic. How should we use?
It's a reality.
But there's another important reality that we need to think.
Arabic is the primary language.
When you look at, you have to be perfect in your primary language to be perfect in other languages.
It's a condition that perfect in the primary language is to be able to express ideas in other languages in a creative way.
Why?
She used Arabic when she started writing for the first time.
All his ideas, images and fantasies were brought from a little boy in the village that was heard of a particular voice.
So when he started to write in English, he had enough basis.
And when he writes his books in English, you feel that box, you're going to pass those parts.
You can imagine that It's the guy who is written in English, who comes from the mountains of Livan.
It's a thing that nobody can fight.
Second, it's often called that if you want to kill a people, the only way to kill a people is to kill his language.
It's a reality that we know for developing companies.
The Germaners, the French, the plants, the Chinese — these nations are different from this race.
So they're making a law to protect their own languages.
They honor it.
So they use the production that they're called, and they pay a lot of money to develop a language.
Do we know more of them?
Well, we don't go from the evolved world, but we don't come to us, and we want to stop with the international world.
One time, they're like us, but they've done research for development, and they've taken their languages with themselves, as Turkey, Malaysian and so they're going to go to these countries, because they didn't take it.
They made the language closer to them.
Because if you take a product from Turkey or another country, and if there's no label on it in Turkish, it's not a native product.
You don't believe that it's a native product.
They were a customer like before, and they've been an unhappy customer as we're in most of us.
So they had to protect their own languages to develop and produce.
"And if I say, ""Laughter, Sufference, Independence" (Laughter) what will you remember?"
What doesn't remember, right?
Who, though, how and why it's.
The language is not only the way we get words from our mouth, it's not the way to talk.
The language shows some stages of our life and the terminology that's connected to our emotions.
"So, when we say, ""Laughter, suverenity, independence,"" we're going to get a particular picture in the minds of each other, in the particular history, there are particular particles for the day."
It's not a language, two or three words or unification.
It's an internal idea about how we think, how we see each other, how others see us.
What's the invention?
Why can you say that this man's going to deal with, right?
"So if I say, ""Laughter, dominance, independence" or if your son came to say, ""Oh, you're living in freedom.""
What do you feel?
If you don't see the problem, it's good that I'm going to go and don't talk to the empty place.
It's the idea that these words remind us something special.
I have a French friend who is married with a French.
I asked him one day, how are the things going to happen?
"He said, ""Every thing is good. But I've tried to translate a whole night for him to translate the word of the letter."" (Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) We write a woman wrongly said to him, ""Laughter"" and then he tried to explain him the word all the night."
"He didn't say, ""How can the man be so crazy?""
Does he want to suicide?
""It's my foundation? (In English)" It's one of a few missions."
We started to think that because we don't deal with the hand, the woman doesn't say that, and it's right to deal with it. It's a mental way that's different.
"And my husband said to me, ""He's listening to Faluza with me, and one night I've tried to translate to him that I'd feel that I heard the Fair."" The writer woman tried to translate it to him, ""I'd extend my hands and I'd put your son."" (Laughter) And this is the problem: ""And because you'd belong to them, I took my hands back and left you."" (Laughter)"
translate it for me.
(Applause) What did we do to protect Arabic?
We turned it into the matter of the civil society, and we started a campaign to protect Arabic.
"So many people said to me, ""What's you going to worry?"
"Don't forget this sense, and you're crazy for yourself."" There's no problem!"
"The thank you for the protection of your language was this: "I talk to you from the East, and you're going to answer me from the West.""
"We didn't say, ""No! We don't accept it or it."" We didn't choose this way, because they didn't deal with us."
And if anyone speaks with me in that way, I hate Arabic.
We say, (Applause) We want to change our reality, and we're going to expand our lives, our desire and our everyday lives.
We're a genius like us, and we're a genius who thinks like us.
"So, ""I talk to you from East, but you're going to answer me from Western.""
It's very simple, at the same time, creative and faithful.
And then we started a new campaign that was written in the torphe.
"You don't see this example in the sky, and on the front of the black and yellow lens, it's written, ""Don't kill your language!""
Why? Of course, don't kill your language.
We don't kill our language from the birth.
If we had to kill our language, we had to find our identity.
We had to find our existence.
We had to go back at the beginning.
It's also a serious question of losing our chance to be modern and global.
And then, we spread images of boys and girls who were flying from Arab cultures.
""Laughter"" pictures of girls and boys."
"We're very cool."
"And anyone says, ""Oh, you're speaking English!"" I say, ""No! I didn't know the word 'cool."" They want to say, how much they believe, but give me a better word that's going to express better."
"I'll continue to say ""Internet."" I'm going to say, ""I'm going to the world's cluster."" (Laughter) Because it doesn't matter, we don't want to forgive ourselves."
But as we come to this point, we have to believe that if it's a question, we don't have to allow those who think there's a population in our face, to manage us or to think and feel what they want to us.
It's the idea of being creative.
If we don't fly on the sky or we can't fix a racket, and so we can be creative.
Now, you're a creative project.
Creation in your primary language is a way.
Let's begin with this.
Let's take a novel, or take a short movie.
One single novel can transform us again.
This can accelerate the Arabic to become a number again.
"So, it's not easy to say, ""There's no way to come out."" There's a way to break."
But we don't know and we need to believe that there's a way to come up, and that is our obligation to be part of the way to come out.
One thing, what can you do today?
What are the flowers, who's the screw?
And if I'm created my time, I'm asking you more, whether it's Arabic, English, French or Chinese.
But when you write in Arabic, don't write with the graph of Latin that you're moving with numbers.
(Applause) It's a miracle! It's not a language!
You're going to go into the virtual world with virtual language.
It's not easy to fly back from that country.
This is the first thing we can do.
Second, there are many other things we can do.
We didn't come up here today to believe each other.
We're here to focus on the importance of protecting this language.
Now I'm going to open you a sir.
The body knows his father for the first time through language.
"And when my daughter was born, I'm going to say to him, ""This is your father, I love you."" I'm going to say to him in English, ""This is your dad, honey."" And my daughter Nura says that in the supermarket, he says, ""Well, thank you."" I'm going to say, ""Merci, Maman."" I'm going to do and I'm going to hope that nobody had heard him."
(Applause) Let's be able to adapt ourselves to this policy. (Applause)
I learned a few things when I took these 30 days studies.
For the test, I took a picture every day in a month.
I'm going to start 30 days studies.
He's very bad.
In fact, they're very compassionate.
(Applause)
Since I read the school, I had a high expectation, and I started a life of a student who was filled with a feeling of love, a journey and a journey.
And I was afraid of being very miserable, incredibly confident, and of the people involved, of the future, and of the gap that I felt in my interior.
"So, as I started, I heard a very painful voice when I was sitting in my room and went out of the room, I heard, ""He left the room.""
There was no one in my side, but the light and the precision of my side was certainly.
"""He opens the door."" I heard."
This was the beginning. It's going to come.
And in the first days, and then in the next few weeks, everything I had done was told me with a third person in part.
"He goes to engineering.""
So, she called neutraals, pain, and even a time later, his friend and his hope, and I thought that this pain would increase the emotions that I didn't give out when I heard.
For example, when I've been in the first time, I've always hidden my imagination and my real particles, the voice came out.
So the arguments behind the sense emerged: normal people don't hear sounds, and I didn't hear was a serious point.
It's the pain that I've taken to my college.
I needed that right, that interest and attention, and I started to talk to him about my magic writer.
"In fact, I worked as a computer of the university news in the student's TV, and I had to talk to the student when he was going to build the night, ""I want to go, I don't go."
And then, the situation started to go out of my surveillance quickly.
I was sitting in the hospital, and then the schizofrene blew, and then the most gravitational: a terrible sense of compassion, compassion and compassion about myself and my future.
My sound was not a new life experience, but because I thought it was a symptoom, I started to increase my fear and compassion.
It was a kind of psychic battle against this fear, which started to increase numbers of sounds and to raise the enemy and to be angry.
Can you see the water that's inside?
In the meantime, I was created a period of fear, of escape, of ignorance and of indiscrimination, and I didn't say that I felt embarrassed in this battle to create peace and peace.
Two years later, my life started to become worse.
Now, I had all the dragonflies of the girl: terrible sounds, wonderful images, incredible, unimaginable numbers.
Now, when I look at the cloud of those years, and I think a person died, and a person was saved.
A bordered and tight person was sent to the village, and he wanted to leave that journey, and then he had to return to someone I had to be going to go to go to the end.
Over my life, many people have lost me, and they're all remembered, but they've been very weak and weak compared to people who helped me.
I think Eleanor's ability to do this.
"And when it's some in the moon, it's going to go back."" He said, "It's not going to do that I'm going to thank those beautiful people who're going to go back to the fight, to fight for me and for me and for me, and that's not going to be able to thank you for those wonderful people who are going to go back."
Of course, it was hard to believe in this because it came to the enemy and the enemy, because I didn't learn to understand my first important step before I had calculated the truth.
For my purpose, I learned to explain the sounds that they're going to attack my house — not as a real and a simple threat, but as a fear and a threat that I feel.
And I always believed them.
One night, even I'm sitting in the gate of my parents, and I remember that I took the rings to protect them from what I actually calculated.
"You can say, ""Don't work with me."
"And I said, ""Do I have a plastic patch that you don't go?"" That's my strategy."
After I realized that, I'm going to go back to psychiatry, and I'm going to go back to a completely different role.
Now I'm proud of being a part of the organization of the International Gender partners of İntervoice, who goes through the work of Mr. Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher, and that's the way to take the voice as a strategy of life, the way to be crying, the ignorance, not as a sign of schizofrenia, but as a difficult, important and meaningful thing to learn.
What this kind of society is possible, but it's still building.
Now, there's a statement that we read that if the social change begins, there's no return.
It's not going to attract people.
Now, it doesn't inspire people who don't fear.
In the last 20 years, we're not going to expand the Earth in five continents and 26 countries, and we're not going to expand the opportunities of people who are suffering, compassion and courage and courage, and we're an ambitious car and an application.
As Peter Levin said, it's a unique creature that has a mental spirit to use this ability that has the human supply instinct.
In this perspective, the greatest honor for our community is to help help someone who needs to give, to be together, to extend the hand, to share and give compassion.
We're invisible. We don't pay money.
What we're doing is never going to take from us or not go from us.
The light doesn't shine forever.
"So my great guy once said to me, ""Don't tell others what they say in your bar."
"So talk about you."" Thank you very much."
(Applause)
I'm here to talk about my photograph.
But what's this photo?
Because, of course, it's not a picture that you can take with your camera.
And again, my friend to photograph started when I took my first photo at 15 years old.
I put it with my friend who was an early interview, but in a little different way, because I planned the process as I use the camera before.
When you take a picture with a photo, the work will be ready when you put the button of the device.
So, because I think, photographing wasn't only made of being right at the right time.
I thought everyone could do this.
So I wanted to create something different, something that started to be done after they were photographed.
So pictures like this: it's a circuit that continues on a road.
But it was surrounded by an unexpected game.
And despite this, it looks really close.
Or pictures like that — both dark and colored, but they're going to protect real reality in a certain degree.
When I say reality, I'm looking at photo reality.
Because, of course, these are not the images that we can actually take, but I wanted to have the visible images that we can take with any camera.
I wanted to have some pictures that you would think about to understand the future.
So it's really connected to take a better idea than to keep a mind.
Well, there's an image that gives him the right look?
Does it relate to these details or to the colors?
Does it relate to light?
What's the creation of Illusion?
It's often the perspective of creating science.
But then, how we understand the world, it's important to do it in the middle of two-dimensional(2D) how to do it.
It's not what this reality really happens, but what are those who look really to us.
So the basic idea is very simple.
I'm going to see this when I put real works into one place, and I'm looking at the inventor of the reality that I created a alternative reality.
I'm going to show you a simple example.
There's three kinds of physical objects that can be perfectly imagined, which are related to our three-dimensional(3D) world.
But when you join in a certain way, it looks like a three-dimensional instrument that is still available.
But we know that it doesn't exist.
So we're playing with our brain because our brain cannot accept that it's not the sense of reality.
And I see the same process when I combine pictures.
It's actually related to combining different realities.
So, something that's true, what we don't think about me, what we don't think about, what we're around us in our everyday lives.
And when they combine pictures, it's really important to look at it, because it's really wrong in a very large way.
What I want to say is three simple sources that we have to do to get a real result.
As you see, there's no particular part of these images.
But when it's connected, it's taken.
So in the first source, the perspective of the combined images should be identical.
Second, the light of the combined images should be the same.
And in these two ways, these two conditions are expected — from the same height and the same light.
And the third thing is that it's impossible to make a picture budget, the picture ends on the edge of one, and separate the beginning of another.
It should be connected in a way that it cannot be separated from how the universe is created.
We remove the limits between the boundaries between different images, adapting the surface, contrast and light, using the depth of the surface, using different images, using the effects like the left color and the light, and allowing us to look like a single picture, although there are hundreds of details in a way.
And that's another example.
(Laughter) People can think that's the official area, and that's the bottom of the changed circle.
But in fact, this picture came to combine pictures of different places.
I think it's easier to create a place, to find a place, and you don't know you need to change your ideas so little.
But this requires a lot of planning.
And I knew that's a few months when I've come in the cloud of my idea, I've been able to find the different places that we're going to do to plan and actually complete the parts of the person who's found.
For example, the fish was taken to keep the official fish.
And these are different places.
Six pieces of water were taken in a stone hole.
And yes, even in the surface of the village, I've made a red to look at the Swedish way.
So it's possible to get a really close result in terms of planning.
There's always a break, it starts with a idea.
And then we're going to combine different pictures.
In this way, every part was very well planned.
And if you look good for pictures, the result can be very beautiful and also very realistic.
So we have all the tools we need, and the only thing we restrict is our vital force.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Julian, thank you.
So there's a data that Wikileaks has published more information than the world's news published in the last few years.
Is that possible?
Julian Assange: Well, can this be true?
Does the rest of the world's media have to be worried about doing so bad? Have a small group of activists able to disseminate more information than the world's media.
CA: How do you do that?
How are people disseminating these documents?
How does the principle of self protect?
JA: So as we know, they're the people who're translating data, and there are different ways to give us the information.
We call countries like Sweden and Belicans to prevent surveillance, to cryp out information to easily disseminate on the Internet, to protect the law.
It's encrypted or encrypted, and it's going to look at the new news agencies, formating — if there's a big database, it can be a little difficult — it's going to open to the government and protect ourselves against the possible legitimate and political attacks.
CA: So that's that means that the law of the document is provided. You don't know who is the source of data very often.
JA: Right. We know them very rarely. If we find the source of data, we immediately destroy that information.
(Applause phone call) Zibil.
(Laughter) CA: I think it's CIA, you ask the code you join TED. (Laughter)
I think we're going to look at the mosquito missions.
This is the information that was broken a few years ago.
Let's look at you.
It was a story from Kenya.
Can you talk about how to get this story out of you?
JA: This is the Royal Report.
After the election of 2004, Kenya was an investigation carried out by the government.
By the election of 2004, Kenya was governed by Daniel Arab Moi for 18 years.
He was a dictator of my property in Kenya.
When they came to the government with the power of the Coalition, they started to fight against corruption, they published this joint report by spending two million pounds.
They also used this report as a political force against Moya, who was the most rich man in Kenya at that time.
It's what's the holy book of journalism in Kenya.
I was going to Kenya just before the 28th century election in 2007, and I could get records.
This report was published three days after the new president Kibabi, Daniel Arab Moon, who started to go to the police of the Arab Moon, and the report was devastated by President Kibabi.
CA: The short of the long word — the report was not directly transmitted to the Kenyan press, but through the roadways, and you think that it changed the result of these elections.
JA: Yes. The news was published on the head page of the Guardian, then in countries around Kenya, Tanzania and Canada in Africa.
The news came out.
And in a few days, the Kenyan press started to write easily about this.
It was released in the Kenyan press for 20 days, and it changed 10 percent of the voice from the Kenyan security service, and it led to change the results of the election.
CA: So what's the information you've actually changed the world?
JA: Yeah.
(Applause) CA: Now, there's a video about the weather cell in India.
The video is quite long. It's a short clip form.
First, I say, there's a little violence in this video.
Radio: ... OK, if you're going to go up.
Now they look at, they look at Xammer.
It's the Earth. The Sun.
Now, when you see all, you know. Thank you.
It's all shot.
The Sun, the fire!
(Automatic weapon fire) Let me look forward, continue. (Automatic weapon fire) I'm going to show.
Bushmaster Two-Six, Bushmaster Two-Six.
You need to go back, here.
It was, we killed all eight people.
There are two vertolyots, and we're going to go to fire.
It was. All died.
Two-Six, Two-Six, we're acting.
Oops. Thank you. What was it?
Zibil, Kyle. Ahaa, it was a solution, yeah.
CA: How was the image of this video?
JA: It's hard for people who're doing this.
Two people were sent to India to investigate this video.
It's actually one of three attacks in the video.
CA: If I don't shoot, there's 11 people who died in this attack, including two employees of Reuters?
JA: Yes. Two Reuters workers died, two children were ran.
In total, 18 to 26 people died.
CA: The publication of these things caused a large impact.
What's the primary reason for this anger and anger?
JA: I don't know exactly, I think people're seeing the unperformance of forces.
They're proud of the astronauts who fly over the birds, who are comfortable, and they're proud of 30mm of gravitational gravitational gravitational gravitational gravitational — and they're killing even those who save the blessing.
There were two journalists who were accurate, who were not scientists, and who saw their own work.
CA: The U.S. security agent Bradley Manning was arrested, and he said, in the interview room, he admitted that 280,000 U.S. government's writing has been suspended for you.
Is that true?
JA: We denied that we took these books.
Five days ago, he was arrested after he had 150,000 writing, 50 years ago.
In the previous year, Reykyavik published the official documents of the U.S. government, but they don't have to do this.
I traveled to the government.
CA: If you had received the diplomatic documents of the U.S. government?
JA: We published them. (CA: We've done this? JA: Yes. CA: Why? JA: The fact that the country has actually done in these documents is that people's rights are found in Arab countries.
If you open a secret document, it's a type of material.
CA: Let's talk about it a little bit more detail.
In all of all, what is the ideology that you rely on?
What do you calculate the publication of a secret document in principle?
JA: There's a question that what information is important for the world, what information can cause to restore.
In fact, it's a lot of information.
It's the idea of the emergence of those new and good news that they're doing to hide the economic power of the institutions, and that institutions who have these data know how to hide their data.
In practice, it's always this. The history of journalism is dependent on it.
CA: But it's not a little dangerous, it's a little dangerous, it can be a bad result for people, even for the whole society, because they're not dependent on you.
JA: There's no case in the information we've been disseminated.
So we have a policy to protect against damage.
There's some personal information that they're going to communicate with themselves and then we're publishing.
There are also blood curves — for example, the advice of the patient with the doctors, these curves are preserved by the law, but we work with the news carriers who really know what they do.
CA: Well, we know all the jobs.
"If someone who's a son in the U.S. office has been close to you, he says, ""Do you know who wants to spread to you with what purpose? This video?"
The American military shows people laugh when they died.
In this world, millions of people show that the American military doesn't have human particles. It's not really.
"My son isn't like this. What's the courage you're doing this?"" What do you answer?"
JA: That's really a lot of things.
But remember that people in India, Iraq, Afghanistan don't need to see this video, they see it every day.
They don't change their minds. They don't change their qualities, their particles.
They see these things every day.
But it's going to change the relationship of people who pay money for this fight. And that's what we're doing.
CA: So you don't find a way to light the secrets of government and companies.
It's good to light.
But it's amazing that you don't have to hide your own sources to light your eyes.
JA: Well, it's not OK. There are no people who are going to fight WikiLeaks.
Of course, we don't have any data that are over the sources.
If there's a lot of things and there's a lot of things, it can be difficult for us. We're doing so that people who are working with us try to help us to continue their work if they're losing us.
CA: It's interesting for me, especially for those I heard like India — what are those who think about this?
There are two kinds of ideas about WikiLeaks and Julian.
One — a grandfather that reveals the relationship.
It's dangerous.
Who think it's amazing?
So what's the danger?
JA: Well, there should be a couple of people if they don't have anything.
CA: These were my property people, Julian.
We're going to try a little more. We're going to show another example.
I think it's not yet published this time, but it's going to be published on TED.
It's a interesting fact that happens in the near future, right?
What's this document?
JA: This is a example of what we see every day.
The last year — in November — in Albania, there were fluctuations like Mexico, but they didn't have been strong as in the galaxy.
We've found that a technical report that actually was carried out by the way that the partition number was carried out by the distribution of cargo cars that the customs of the companies were placed.
And the government of Albania and others were here.
But the technical report didn't have any relationship with them. It was a little difficult document.
We didn't know who wrote and what it's about.
We've been a little doubt that it could be a game of the Chinese oil company.
"So we looked at the document, and we wrote this answer, ""We're a little doubt."
We don't know what we're going to do.
"Laughter is you. It looks correct, but we can't confirm."" One week ago, we've responded from the company who wrote this article — (Laughter) So, ""We want to find the source of information."" We said, ""Don't give little information."
In all of all, what document are you talking about?
Does it belong to you as your blood?
"Are you really?"" They said, in response, they sent Microsoft Word ID on the screen, and they sent the list of the owner of the document."
That's what it's going to break.
(Applause) That's actually a lot of things.
One of the ways to determine the source of material is one of the ways to write a letter.
CA: Have you some information about BP?
JA: Yes, and so much, but we're actually doing funding for the website, and engineers go out of their hands.
We've reduced the news that we've been published for the last few months to protect our social interests, because we've tried to restore the key of the website.
It's a little problem.
As the other institutions that start in new activity, we're also confronted with the problems of getting up from each other, but we don't have enough employees to transmit and publish all of these data, but we don't have enough data.
CA: Do you say, you're going to pay a job for major volunteer journalists and/eller journalists?
JA: Yes. People we're going to believe.
It's also difficult to develop one of the data that we're doing in a little different way, and we need people who can start with high-scale security and now.
CA: Can you tell you why you start this job?
And I'm going to say, I'm not reading that you're going to change 37 schools when you're a kid.
Is this true information?
JA: My Valideans were in a movie business, and I didn't fly from religious meetings, and they were the result of them.
(Laughter) CA: Psychologists accepted that as a paranoia sense.
JA: Do you look at the movie business?
(Laughter) (Applause) CA: Because I know, when you were young, you were a hackers, it was a problem with the messenger.
JA: I was a journalist.
I was one of the young journalists.
I was arrested because I was published in a young age.
You have to take a little attention to hackers.
It's possible to do different things with the systemic path.
Unfortunately, most of the Indian hackers have been engaged to put money in a bank account for the Russian mafia.
The Xarker was not like before.
CA: I don't think you've been trying to put out what kind of people. What are the main values?
Can you give short information about them, or can you talk about why they're created or about events?
JA: I think there's no short event.
But my fundamental values: I think, talentful and compassionate people don't create sacrifices; they help victims.
And that's what my father, my father, I've learned from people who were in my life, like my father.
CA: The poor, the poor, the poor, don't create human victims; does it protect them?
JA: I'm a little prosecutor, I'm not going to protect them completely, but I'm going to protect the victims by detecting people from crime.
And that's my character that I have for a long time.
CA: Can you talk about what's happening in Iceland in the last few minutes?
Because you've published there, it's a problem with the bank, and the news agency that gives information was also brought to the court.
And in fact, the website was gravitated.
You've created a good image in Iceland. What happened then?
JA: This was a big question.
It was a economic crisis in Iceland.
It was one of the largest insects in the world.
The global goods in the banking sector was 10 times more than the other areas.
We published this information in July of the last year.
"5 years before the money was released in the TV, it was sent to the TV court. Five years of the news of the court, like in the movies, started before, and the device didn't know what would do, "No. What did we do?""
We published news instead of TV on a web address, and we've been very busy in Iceland, even when we went and talked about the question.
In the government, everyone believed that it would be done again. So, after we've seen some Icelandic politicians and international experts, there's a new law project that will be a security of justice to the government of Iceland, which is one of the fundamental laws that will protect journalists in the world, which are the same as the Nobel Prize for freedom.
Iceland knew that other skandinavi countries, like Norway, were introduced into the system.
And just a month ago, this law was secretly adopted in the Islamic Parliament.
CA: Vouu
(Applause) Let's be an amazing water, Julian.
How will you believe that you're going to go? How will you believe that the Big Bang will control everything in a secret way, or people will like to control the Big Bang, or it's something else?
JA: I'm not sure what it's going to be.
All over the world — from the U.S., from China and from the U.S. — it's going to increase the terms of freedom of speech and of self.
It's hard to see how you're going to go.
The time we're living is very interesting. We can change everything in a very strange way.
CA: Yes, I feel what our listeners want to say, Julian, be careful, have power with you.
JA: Thank you very much, Chris. (CA: Thank you.) (Applause)
I'm a writer.
I'm going to tell stories and write a roman. I'm going to tell you about a little bit about the story today, and I'm going to talk about a little bit about the universe called cin.
But I'm going to talk about your personal story before you start it.
Of course, I'm going to use words, and you're going to find a few places when you hear my voice.
I was born in a Turk family in Strasbourg, in France.
So, just after that event, my validity is separated, and I went to Turkey like my mother.
And then, I grew up as a single child in my mother's art.
In the 1970s, the situation in Ankara was a little strange.
Most of the families in our family were large families that were the father's family leader, and I grew up with my mother who was single married in the patriotic environment.
In fact, I grew up around two groups of single women.
On the one hand, he was my mother, a young, modern, European Turk woman.
But, on the other hand, it's always a religious, less compassionate, less rationalized mind.
I'm looking at the dragonflies of the dragonflies in the crater, and it's in different ways that she's able to remove the eyes of the Devil.
And they're going to visit what they're deep in their hands, people who're poor in their hands.
Every time, what I'm going to put anything in Arabic, it's getting red in the hand, and it's going to cut the golden dragonflies like the number of the losses that I've taken in the hand.
And then, each other was covered by galaxies.
One week later, he went to the hospital for the mosquito.
I know that it can be amazing to talk about these things in front of the scientific audience and the scientist, but I didn't see that nobody came back to any of the people who were going to treat different dragonflies, or who didn't give them.
And I asked me how did I do. It was the power of God?
"He said, ""Well, God has good, but it's the power of fundamental things."" And there's a lot of important lesson in my teachings, if you want to do anything in life, or if you want to do something in your life, or if you want to do something, or if you want to do something, or the soul of the human, you need to go through the dragonflies."
It's going to be built inside.
We all have been inside the social and cultural areas.
We're all inside him.
We're all born in a kind of family, in a kind of scale, in a kind of income.
But when we don't connect with a day outside the world, we're confronted with the risk of making it out of the world.
We can reduce our physical power. Our product is suspended. We can lose our sense of humanity when we're very long in our environment.
Our friends, our neighbors, our colleagues, our partners, our family, if we're going to listen to us, and if we read very much, we're deeply involved in ourselves.
In Turkey, women like me, do something like that, they're going to cover the power with particles, or they turn the surface of the power to the wall.
This perspective goes beyond the faith that exists. It's not easy to look at his image for a lot of time.
Well, it's one of the greatest dangers of our world that can live in the minds that can share reading ideas.
And it starts everywhere, between liberals and the monarchs, the aqnostic and the faithful, the beings and the poor, the East and the West.
We form groups based on fluctuations and similarities, and we create stereotypes about others.
I think, writing industry could be the key way to pass these political gets.
And if stories don't put the boundaries, they're able to go on the streets of our minds.
We can also like to see these things because of the other worlds, even because of what we see.
I started to write stories from my eight years old.
One day, my mother gave me a color of color, and he told me that my personal stories would be a good idea to write it.
Now I think it was a little fear of thinking about that time.
I didn't share my stories with my family in my house, but I didn't talk to my family friends.
I was an introvert kid to talk with the dragonflies, and I thought that my mother was a good idea to write my everyday stories.
But he didn't know that I thought that my life was really tough, and what I wanted to do was to write about this uninteresting life.
Instead, I started to write about myself, not about myself, but about things that's not about others.
So I started to make a writer that would be transformed into my love of life.
First, writing was the life of more people than the autobiographic manifest for me, stories of others.
Let me look at a little bit: I'm going to explain these events that happen in my life.
And there's another thing that happened in the cluster of this area.
My mother was a diplomat.
And I went out of this small, emotional, medium-scale environment, and I was in the international school environment in Madrid. I was the only Turk in the school.
"The first time I was in a difficult environment that I expressed as ""typic foreign."" There were children from all the nations in India, but that was not a cosmopolitan or an institution of eukaristic democracy that would be seen in school."
In fact, in this museum, children were accepted as they represent their personalities, not themselves, rather than a larger people.
We were like the U.S., and it was crazy, or it's going to do a bad event in behalf of the people or talk about it.
So the child was surrounded by the source of infectious diseases, and it's always happening.
And I remember that when I was in this school, I was a military circuit in Turkey, trying to kill the Turk's armed Papan, and in the Eurovision music, Turkey took 0 numbers.
(Laughter) At that time, I started to fly from school and become a marine.
So, for the first time, I saw a political stereotype understanding in this school.
"They asked me all of the kids, who I didn't look at, about ""Midnight Express."" They asked me to take a few cigarets every day, and they took all kinds of cigarets for them, and they asked me to hide my head when they started to age."
I learned three strereotips related to Turkey here, these were: politics, cigarets and headquarters.
After Spain, we returned to Ireland, Germany and back to Ankara.
I thought that my self and my vital force could be transported with me, and I thought that it's a travel box, all of our trips.
Stories gave me a sense of coherence, of continuity and of persuasion — I didn't have these particles in the real life.
When I was 20 years old, I moved to the city of Istanbul.
I lived in a very cosmopolite and living environment, and I wrote a single of my stories here.
I was there when I was sick in Istanbul in 1999.
The show that I saw out of the street that I saw at the 3th morning stopped me.
Hisly, he had a senior seller, he didn't sell alcohol in the shop, he didn't talk to people outside and living in marginaal lives.
In the beginning, the long black pair was sitting at the front of the transsexual, which was spread to the surface of the eye.
And I saw that he offered him from the dragonflies of the dragonflies with the dragonflies of the dragonflies, and that's the event that I'm going to be in my mind of the night — that's going to take dragonflies along the front of the transsexual that is crying with the protector.
When we're confronted with death and gravity, we're all one, but we're all one.
But I always believed that stories have a read effect.
I don't want to say that science is strong as a failure. But when you read a good novel, we're going to go away from our comfortable room, never found in the dark of the night, and sometimes we don't have a good idea of people.
And just after that happened, I went to Boston, and then I went to the college of girls in Michigan.
It's not only a geographical basis, but that's a complete change from my view of language.
I started to write in English.
I'm not going to go to the government, I'm not going to travel. They ask everyone about why I'm not writing in English. It helps me to change my writing language to change myself.
I love writing in English, I'm more poetic and emotional. I love writing in English, I think it's more mathematical and intelligent.
I think I'm connected with each other language.
As millions of people in the world, I've learned English later. It's a language that's going to go back.
And when you learn a little language later, you're able to lose what you've learned.
As we don't come to the language later, we want to talk more, to work better words, to make better insects. We talk less, because there's a big difference between our brain and our language.
This difference is fearful.
But if we learn to don't worry about him, it can stimulate us.
And that was that I learned in Boston — it was the rain that I lived, and it was a flute stimulus.
And in those moments, I'm going to get married to what I'm going to follow all my activities, and what I'm going to do with a growing concern for the day, and I'm able to stay in one place, just after he's going to preaching.
I created a family life because he loved what God.
(Laughter) But I went to Arizona instead of deciding anywhere.
And because my friend was in Istanbul, I started to walk between Arizona, Istanbul, and I couldn't feel that different at the other two points of the world.
If I mean, a part of my thing is always translating, in terms of physical and spiritual.
So my stories are always with me to keep all my love and parts in me.
And I think he's going to lose his story when it's more real than the story.
I'd like to take a view like you about this.
One of the books I wrote in English, when I looked at light in America, one of the public contesters said that.
"The book liked me."" He said, "But you would write a little different thing.""
(Laughter) I asked what I wanted to say.
"And I'm going to look at you, we're going to see that many Spanish, American, Spanish, but there's only a Turk who's a man."" And it's actually going to go to the campus in Boston. It's normal because there's more people than Turkey, but I'm going to understand what the speaker wants to say."
But I know he's always going to continue to move him.
He always wanted to be my personal manifest.
He wanted to be a Turkish woman in my book because I was a Turkish woman.
We're always talking about changing the world of stories, but we can also see that politics has impact on dissemination, reading and understanding.
Most of the writers, especially not south-west writers, are suffering from this experiment.
If you're women from the Islamic world like me, they're waiting to write about the Islamic woman, it's better than that Muslim woman is not happy.
They're waiting for you to write more information, curious, very typical stories, to stop from the west perspective.
When I was young, in Madrid, my troubled prboles were also available in the world literature of India.
Letters look like creative people with personal ideas, not as a representative of institutions and countries. Some writers from China, some of them from Turkey from Nigeria.
They're not different, they're waiting to adapt to our society.
In 1984, when the writer and the visitman took a interview from James Baldw, they asked him a couple of times about homosexuality.
"Who takes the Internet, when he tried to appreciate him as a blue writer, Baldwin said, ""You don't see that I don't have anything else?"" And I have the same thing that we have in all."" When the politics marks us, it's under the danger of our freedom."
There's an unprecedented catecture that all the writers who don't have from the west have been involved.
About 10 years ago, I remember the first great reading in Harvard.
We were three writers, one from Philippines, one from Turkey, one from Indonesia, one from India.
(Laughter) But that brings us together, we didn't have a public or a public obligation.
It's just our passport.
People who are from another country are waiting to write real stories.
It's actually used to make a function.
In this way, not only writers, but their artists are also a part of a larger mass.
I don't have to imagine that this approach to story doesn't exist in the West.
It's so in the world.
I saw that for the first time in 2005, when I was released to the court because of the history of history.
I worked to write a creative, multi-dimensional story about Turkey and the family of women with the eye of women.
My little story was transformed into a big macro problem when I was brought to the Court.
Because I wrote about the Turk-India conflict, some were criticized to me, and some were appreciated.
But at that moment, I wanted to say to both sides, that's just literature.
It's just a story.
"I don't want to reduce the value of what I saw when I said, ""Just story.""
I love and support it because it's not because it's thinking about how it's.
The writers are recognized because they're looking at the universe, but the political books are enough today, and the language of literature is not the day-to-day politics.
"Cexov says, ""The right way of the solution and the correct layout of the matter is completely different."
"And it's the job of the artist to make the second."" The politics separates us from each other. The equation unifies."
Some are involved in sharing.
It's the difference between the numbers.
Some take a limit.
The numbers don't know the boundaries.
The politics is made from a strong cluster.
It's actually the water.
"In the Osman, there were people who spoke to a science story called ""Laughter."" They went to the prisoners, and they told stories that they were very rare before the artist."
They change their sounds to express different images in the story, and they're not able to make them.
All went to listen to him, new people, even king, Muslims, non-Muslims.
"The galaxies exceeded the limits, as the Middle Asia, the East Africa, the Balkans and the Asia, called ""Laughter of the Earth.""
Now stories continue to pass the boundaries.
They don't hear each other when the Palestinian and the Israeli politicians talk, but the Palestinian writer read the work of the Israeli writer read the work of the Palestinian writer, and it's connected with the way of history.
In fact, science has to bring us closer.
If you don't look at this, it's not a good story.
The books saved me — a kid who was embarrassing and embarrassing for a time.
But there's a threat to budgeting books.
After the writer and the chef Rumi found his spiritual friend with the Sams Library, the first job of Samsin was to love the destruction of those who were written in the room and put the books of Rom.
"So we say, ""The knowledge that doesn't distort you, it's more than ignorance."" The problem of today's political gettos is not the lack of ignorance or knowledge that we know about each other, we think we know more about each other, we don't be distorted by our knowledge, we're elite, we're distorting from others and we're losing our relationship."
There's a pattern that I love: living like the behavior of the kompass.
One of the dimensions of the kompass is stable.
And that's what I'm going to do, and it's going to go out.
And my works are so.
It's a part of my books that I've written, I've been moving to Istanbul to Turkey, and the other part is moving around the world, and it's connected with different institutions.
In this perspective, my works account for both domestic and universal, and I believe that it's relevant for us and all.
If you travel to Istanbul, you're going to see the House of Topkap, which is the coast of the eighth sultans for 1400 years.
In the village, there's a place called the Point of View of Cinks in the room of the oceans.
That's the place between the buildings.
I'm very pleased with this approach.
We don't believe in the regions that are between us.
We calculate those places that are made from a explosive fire, and that's a symbol of transformation, which is accepted as a symbol of gravitational beings — the mass of gravity.
And I think, it's going to be a lot of artists who are looking for.
I'm going to take advantage of the change that I write and the multitasking.
I'm like to think about 10 books later.
I love my leaders to inspire me.
I can talk about a Muslim woman in one of my stories, and there's a great chance to be a happy woman, who can be a wonderful blue professor from Norway, who's the story of my other work.
We can talk about everything for the time we're coming from.
"Audo Lorde says, ""Our grandfather says, ""I can say, ""He says, ""I'm going to say, ""I'm going to say, I'm going to lose."" That's a example."
And I don't understand why we're going to write about what you know when we learn writing.
Maybe it's not very good for the beginning.
Creator doesn't depend on what we are, what we know and how we have personality.
We have to teach young people and each other to write about what we feel open.
We have to go away from the national gettons, we have to recognize the other worlds.
It's like the dragonflies, the dragonflies of the universe.
Because they're not dependent on the political situation, they're unified all the universe, and that's a good news.
"And I wanted to finish my mind with the old surface, ""We're familiar with all, we're friends, we're doing things, love, world is a fan of the world."" Thank you very much."
(Applause)
My big idea is a little idea that will reveal a big idea of a secret million in us.
I'm going to sleep this little idea.
(Laughter) (Applause) Here's a group of women. There's a couple.
They're women.
And I realized very hard the value of the top.
Two and a half years ago, I lost my mind from fatigue.
My head was worth the table, my foot was hot, my right eye was shot five points.
I started to understand the value of the hair at that time.
I looked at that time, I spoke to students, teachers, and so I could tell him that the only way to become more productive is to stay normal.
(Applause) In this circle we're going to do women.
We're going to be the most cool in the real sense of the word.
(Laughter) (Applause) Because it's very surprising that it's calculated as a little sleep person.
And when he was crying with a person, he started to talk about he was sitting four or four hours in the first night.
"I said, I went out of my life, I didn't say, ""You know."
"If you had five hours, would the Indian skin be more interesting?"" (Laughter) So many people sleep less."
"If you want to invite someone to eat this morning, here, in Washington, and you ask, ""What's the eighth hour?"" They're going to say, ""8 night, but there's nothing, they're a little tennis, they're going to call a few places after I'm going to talk to you."" They think they're already engaged and produced, but I think they're not going to do that, because there's a lot of leaders who don't take a lot of wrong decisions in economic, political and commercial."
It's going to be high.
It's not going to be a good leader, but to be a good leader before you're going to go to the Indian Titanic.
There's enough asteroids that look like our Titanics.
I think Lehman Brothers (The Big Investment Bank of Britain) would have been Lehman Brothers and Brothers.
(Applause) When the kids worked 7 days 24 hours, seven or eight hours sleeping girls could see the island, maybe they could understand why it's going to happen.
In a period that we're confronted with a lot of particles, it's the best thing that we can enjoy our lives, not depend on what we live, because it's not dependent on the world.
And I'm a very simple thing that you can't see the big ideas of you, you can't see your eyes, remove your devices, find the power of your sleep.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I was like a boy who had a woman body.
If you can see the brain, you can see that the brain is composed of two separate half-dimensional galaxies.
Thank you for a minute. Thank you very much. It was fun.
The previous information on the energy has been spread to all the emotional systems at the same time, showing how the memory looks, how it rains, how it rains, how it feels and how it sounds.
We're a energy that's connected to the energy around us through the right brain.
And at this point, we're perfect, full and invisible.
But the left brain is a completely different place.
The left half is a methodic idea.
And the left brain thinks in any language.
The only thing I could do was foreign energy — power.
"And I say, ""What do you see me?"
I feel the universe in my body. Thank you.
