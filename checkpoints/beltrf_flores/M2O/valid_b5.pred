(Applause) I'm looking for a story in Allah from the Sun, in the name of Allah, a compassionate and a compassionate.
I was born in a high school family.
That's why I was so excited.
My mother had 16 children.
From 16 children, only five stayed alive.
Imagine what my childhood was.
Every day, I saw women who were pursued to love or children who went to visit their brains.
I wanted to be a computer to help women and children.
Unfortunately, I didn't have girls' media in my country, so I was introduced to a medical school, but I couldn't visit it.
And my father sent me to America.
I moved to America.
I finished my education.
As I got to school, my country had military entered.
You know, when I was a college, I didn't even know what happened to my family and to my country.
It was months, years, but I didn't know anything.
My family was in refugee camps.
As soon as I graduated from school, I moved my family to America.
I wanted them to live in security.
Where was my heart?
My heart was in Afghanistan.
I had a good job.
I gave you a job.
And so I went to the refugee camp.
When I went to this camp in Pakistan, I saw 7.7 million refugees, 7.7 million refugees.
About 90 percent of them were women and children, and most of them were killed or killed, and you can see when I was in refugee camps.
When I surveyed every day, I sent things that you can't imagine.
I saw one of the three and a half kids sitting and crying, and she didn't know what to do.
I saw a young woman who couldn't go anywhere, had no education, no fun, no place to live.
It was a very astonishing situation.
At that point, we're talking about momentum.
"At that point, I asked myself, "What can I do for these people?""
How can I help them?
At that point, I realized that education changed my life.
She changed me, gave me status.
At that point, I realized that I had to give my people education and health, and that was what I started working on.
Do you think I was easy?
No, because at that point, education was completely distracted by girls.
"The challenge was to come and say, ""I want to do that."" Who am I?"
Did they trust me? Natural, no.
That's why I had to put a door in this community.
How did I do that?
I did research, and I looked, I looked.
I tried.
I was 80 years old.
He was cute.
"He looked at me, and he said, ""Wow, a girl girl. How can I become a teacher?"" And I said to him, ""I'm going to be a teacher from you."" After all, he came up. And when I started talking about him, the stories began to spread."
Even one year later, we had 25 schools, and 15,000 kids who wanted to go to these schools, and that was incredible.
Of course, we're working, we're cutting teachers. We're making women's rights, human rights, law enforcement, we're going to do different training. One, I'll tell you.
I was at the office in Beijing, Pakistan one day.
"And I've always seen how my teachers run to the rooms, open doors and say to me, ""Hey, go!"" If you're right, what are you doing?"
You're attacked. You know it's dangerous.
You know that your life is on the corner.
But as a leader, you have to be brave.
You've got to marry, and you've got to feel strong.
So I asked them for me.
They've come in. They've got balloons.
I asked them to sit, and I offered a hardware.
They stopped saying they wouldn't drink the bread.
Of course, their tone, their voice that they talked to me, really struck me. I was really excited.
But I was strong, I felt strong.
"They said, ""What are you doing?"
My students started to enter the office.
They started opening the cells.
They worked with their mother and their children.
They were training about women's health.
We've done all the training that you can only imagine.
I was happy. I was fascinated by the challenges of my work.
There are only four trainers, one guard, and I went to the end of Kabul, and again, we suddenly stopped the road of 19 young people.
With the dots on the bottles, they took us the way.
This time, we're all killed.
We can see where you're going.
Everybody flew home. Nobody stayed.
I only had a security guard. I lost my voice.
There were hundreds of women coming to get education.
Now, I was sitting and unexpected — at this point, we're talking about the impulse — at this point one of my wonderful donors was asking for the job.
"She said, ""Sakeena?"" I said to her."
Today, these people have the best coaches.
And — (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
It tells us that education changes people.
I live in a country that was beautiful and good.
I just want to share with you.
We could go wherever we wanted.
Do you know what happened to my country?
Today, people can't get out of the house, don't worry about security.
But we want to go back to our old Afghanistan.
They get the depths and learn about the feedback.
They said that with respect and love, we can embrace the world.
Server-Aficience: What do you expect?
client:mm, let's take a look.
Server: I'm going to do a little bit of a little bit of a second-and-a-half-year model that's patrolled by the best corrupt data, two-coded bread, two-coded butterflies, fiber fiber fiber fiber, and this salad is hidden with a polymorphic spider, and it's printed with a code.
client: I'm, please, a battery of an authentic memory, and you're going to buy it's a mile of your best code.
сърver: Is there anything in the room?
We've got an enormous amount of data.
client: Give you a bunch of coworkers, please.
SS: Well, it's the best thing to do.
I'm going to do your order quickly.
(Applause) My Pan: I draw from that couple how I learned to keep a kid in my hand, and I draw a cartoon cartoon in girls from the age three.
And then I learned who are these animators.
In the television, they found a program on education that most children don't know.
"When I realized that animators are the ones that make cartoons that I've been looking at on the screen, I just said, ""I want to be an animator!"" I don't know if I've all told it, or myself, but it was the greatest moment of my life."
The design of animation and history has always been my favorite stuff.
"But the interest in computer technology was the idea of creating an animation called ""The Golden Goats."" (Laughter) My computer had a virus, and I tried to ignore it, and suddenly I thought, what if there was my little world in the middle of the computer?"
Could there be any kind of shop where they're meeting to work together?
That's how the Golden Goats were born.
When I was four years old, my father showed me how to break the computer into parts and reassemble it.
So I had this hard to computer technology.
The first one I've got online, I've built the language of Microsoft, and now I'm learning the language of Microsoft and Microsoft.
"And I'm also developing a new animation called ""Audience."" It's about bees and other explorers that exist in the environment, and why they're creative."
If the flowers weren't going to be the ones, all the things that depend on gender would end up going to die of nakedness.
So I decided to use these files and do their superhero command.
(Applause) (Applause of legs) (Music) (Applause) Audience: Absolutely! Who else!
You have to call the rest of the Askers!
(Music) Thank you. (Applause) All my animations started with ideas, but what are ideas?
ideas can inspire movements.
The ideas are selfishness and new development.
Because of the ideas, the world is turning around.
If not ideas, we wouldn't be where we are now, we wouldn't have technological or medical outcomes, we wouldn't have culture, culture, our lifestyle.
When I was eight years old, I took my ideas, and I opened up the idea of the May, and next to them, the foundation of May for the planet.
(Laughter) I produce ecological feedback and oxytours.
I'm 13 years old, and despite the fact that I started in 2008 in 2008, my artistic development started a little bit earlier.
A lot of influences on me always showed history, and I wanted to help him to everything I was doing, including my firm.
The first one is growing tissue in the need, and I thought you could make a glass or a bottle of it — I had so many ideas about designing the material!
"And I noticed that when I did my products, I was stopped on my school and said, "How do I tell you. Where can you buy this?""
And I thought, well, that's what you can do and open up a company.
Because I was only eight years old, I didn't have any major design plans for the company.
I just knew that I wanted to produce beautiful things that wouldn't cover the environment, and that I wanted to share with you that I less loved in my life.
My mother taught me to sleep, and I sat on a walk behind my house, and I made connections to the head of the tape, and on the table I wrote the name and the king for every single piece of mine.
I started creating more expressions, like shoes, sticks and bags.
My product was being bought all over the world, and I had clients in Denmark, Italy, Australia, Canada and other countries.
And I realized, I had a lot to learn about managing things like, for example, corporate name and sales, how to maintain relationships with the clients and see what's going on better or worse.
The little company started growing.
And one day, when I was 10 years old, I had a relationship with Forbes magazine.
(Laughter) They wanted to write about me and my firm in their sport.
How many people ask me, why do I have ecological properties?
As a young age, I've been very interested in the environment and the creatures that live in them.
My parents early taught me to share with those who were less happy, and with the mind and the passion to get into the environment.
I learned that tissue color or even the process would produce things that were dangerous to humans and to the planet, and I started my research and I found that even after coloring, there was a problem for the environment in what we didn't know what to do with the waste.
With the rest of the process of measuring colors, or with the rest, the dryest color.
It pollutes the air, making it taxic to everyone and everyone who breathes it.
So when I started with the finish, I knew two things: all my products should be ecological, and that 10 to 20 percent of my money should be paid to local and global public institutions.
(Applause) I consider myself part of a new call of entrepreneurs who don't just want to make money, but also hope for sustainable development in the world.
I believe that I can distract my collectors, and I hope that the future generations are willing to live more ecologically clean lives.
We live in a big, diverse and beautiful world, and from that, I'm still paying more to protect it.
To do what happens in the world just through mind and mind is not enough.
Everything needs to be done through the heart, because that's when the idea of organizing movements is created.
It's only when creativity and innovation can see the world, because the idea is being real.
Thank you very much for happiness.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Pat Mitchell: You've ever heard how I talked about my parents who are behind this magical woman. Where are they?
Please, the Lord and the advice of Pan, maybe you — you.
(Applause)
Here's a couple of discoveries of galaxies.
The name coincides dramatically with curiosity.
They're inviting these colorful collections of galaxies that are interconnected with collective gravity.
The majority of the crops that you see on the screen are not the only stars, but the selection of the star, or the galaxies.
Now, showing you some of these findings, I think you'll see quickly that connectivity of galaxies is not just a beautiful object, but more than that, I think connectivity of galaxies is mysterious, they realize, and they're creative.
They're critical as the source of the most powerful laboratory meeting.
And in its role as a laboratory, the signature of connectivity means the signature of experiments that you can deliver over them.
I think there are four basic types, and the first type you want to learn about is in the order of something very large.
Now, how big is it?
Well, it's a discovery of one particular combination of galaxies.
It's so massive that the light that goes through it comes out because of the extraordinary gravity of this connection.
And first of all, when you look very carefully, you're going to be able to see the circle around the universe.
To avoid being vocal, this particular connectivity of galaxies weighs more than one million billion suns.
It's astillalistic how massive these systems can be.
But more than that, they have an extra feature.
They're essentially isolated systems, and if you're lucky, we can think of them as minor versions of the whole community.
"And on a lot of questions that can happen in us about the ultimate world, for example, "How does gravity work?""
You can answer by studying these systems.
Yes, that's what we've talked about an incredible crowd.
The other kind of thing is that these things are very cool.
So if you take the detection of the connectivity of galaxies, and you take away all the lights that are coming out of stars, then then you become this big, blue dot.
It's an unreasonable cortex.
What we see here is, in fact, the rhinogenous light.
So the question is, if it's not a galaxy, what changes that light?
And the answer will be hot gas, a million-degree gas — it's actually plasma.
And the beginning of this garage can be found on the last slide.
The extraordinary gravity of these systems unites the current of gas and gives them a huge speed, and the huge speed, at its own, is a huge amount of energy.
That's the main point, but it's just a scientific sketch.
There's also a lot of other features of this plasma, which, as much as the puzzle for us is, is going to hit us, and yet it's going to push our understanding of physics for the most hot goals.
Third, learning is very small.
To tell you about it, I need to tell you about the concern.
The majority of the maths of the meeting are not made of attacks.
You've been manipulated.
The majority is made up of something very, very mysterious that we call dark material.
The dark material is something that's not very good for us, except for the cost of gravity, and we may have to learn more about it.
If you're interested in physical times, you're interested in what happens when we click something on each other.
And the dark material is not a switch.
How can we do that?
"When I answer this question, I'm going to answer a little bit more, "What happens if the connect galaxy hits?""
Let's look at the discovery.
We remember that the galaxies are even crazy together, just in a smaller version.
They're different from the dark matter, and that's what you see in this blue purple.
The black is hot gas, and eventually you can see a lot of galaxies.
What's happening here is the scanning of time at a very, very large scale.
And that's very important, because it means that very, very small effects that are difficult to get out of the lab can connect and connect to something that we can see in nature.
Yeah, that's a lot of fun.
The reason why galaxies can teach us about what dark material is, the reason why galaxies can teach us about physics very small, is that they're so big.
Part of the thing: physics is very strange.
It's the result that it's done to get your head out of it.
If there's something more strange, it has to be dark energy.
If I put the balloon in the air, I'm waiting for it to heat up.
But I don't expect it to fly coal at a higher and higher speed.
So cosmologists also explain why the world is built.
They don't understand why it's getting more and more fast.
They give this opportunity to accelerate the name, and they call it dark energy.
But we also want to understand more about it.
Now, one particular question that rises is, how does dark energy influence the world at the most powerful scale?
And depending on her brain, the structure can get its risks faster or faster.
And the problem of meeting at large is that it's very complex.
Let's look at the program simulation.
We need nothing to do with it.
I want to think about it using analogies.
To understand, as the Titanic said, the most important thing is not the model of the location of every small car car that's broken.
The most important thing is to see the two largest parts.
And so I can learn a lot about the world at the greatest scale, waiting for its greatest parts, and these parts are connective galaxies.
After all, I'm going to end my talk, but you can feel a little bit of cheating.
I'm considering what I'm going to start with how strong the connectivity of galaxies is, and I've shown a few of these reasons, but how do you actually use them?
Well, to report, I want to work with Henry Ford when he was asked about cars.
"What he said was, ""If I tried in people what they needed, they would say they needed the best horses."" Our society is confronted with a very large number of problems."
And the solution to these problems is not obvious.
They're not the fastest horses.
They require an incredible number of scientific innovations.
So we need to focus on, yes, we need to focus, but we also need to remember innovation, innovation, inspiration — these things come along as we expand our field of vision, when we step back, when we look away.
And for me, the best way to do this is to learn the world around us. Thank you.
(Applause)
"So imagine you're going to be in a college somewhere in America, and here's a Japanese coming to you and saying, "Look what this block is called?""
"And you say, ""Look. Well, that's the Oak Street, and that's the Alm Street."
"This is a dozen, and this is a dozen."" He says, ""Well, okay. What's called this block?"" You say, ""You know, there are no names in the blocks."
"The people have names; the blocks are just an infinite bridge between the streets."" It comes out, a little bit confused and frustrated."
"All right now, imagine what you're standing in the street, you're going to Japan, you're going to go to the person looking at you, and you're going to say, "Look what's called this house?""
"They say, ""Oh, that's the 17 block, and that's the 16 block."" And you say, ""Well, okay, but what's the name of this site?"" And they say, ""How do you say, there's no name in the house."
There are names in the blocks.
Here's Google Maps. There's a block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
There are names in all of these blocks, and the streets are just an infinite bridge between the blocks.
"And you're like, ""Well, okay, but how do you know your home address?"" And he said, ""Well, that's simple: That's the eightth place."
"There's a 17th block. There's a number one house. You say, ""Fina. But as I walk around 2, I noticed that women are not engineered by default."" And he said, ""You can't make a pattern. Number depends on when women were built."
The house that was built in the block of the other is the home number one.
The house that was built by the second is the home of zero two.
"The third house is a house of zero three. It's simple. It's obvious."" Well, I'm very excited that sometimes we need to go to the other side of the world to understand something that we haven't even imagined about, and to understand that there are absolutely simple things that are possible."
So for example, there are doctors in China who believe that their work is to support your health.
So every month you don't get sick, you're wearing them, and if you don't get sick, you don't need to pay them because they're not able to deal with their work. They're rich when you're healthy, not when you're sick.
"(Applause) But in any music, ""Ris"" is the beginning of a musical phrase. One, two, three, four."
"One in the north African music, ""Now,"" is the end of the phrase that the Chinese said."
You can hear it not only in the words, but also in the way they count the notes of music: two, three, four, once.
And this map is also right.
(Laughter) To say that in every truth that we're talking about India, there's a bias that also becomes a truth.
So let's not forget that either at TED, or not yet, that independent from what a brilliant idea you have or you hear, its tolerance can also be true.
Domo arigato gozaimashita.
