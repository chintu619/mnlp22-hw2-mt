By the end of this year, there will be about a billion people on the planet who are actively being used by satellites.
They know that they're going to die.
Because it's a great thought, but I think it has serious consequences that we need to see.
For the first time, I thought about this after a post on Derek K. Miller, a science-tech journalist who died of cancer.
Miller asked his family and friends to write a written post that was published after his death.
That's what he wrote in the beginning.
"He said, ""All right. I died, and that's my last post on the blog."
"So I asked, as soon as my time was going to get rid of my cancer, my family and my friends published a readable message that I wrote as the first part of my blog coming from an active book."" It's not true that as a journalist, the Billers' archive could be published better, and more documented, the fact that everybody today creates archives that are completely different from what was created by any future generation."
Let's take a look at the roof of the statistic.
Now 48 hours of video is uploaded to YouTube every week.
200 million tweets per day.
The average Facebook user creates 90 units of content a month.
If you think about their parents or their grandparents, in the best way, they made a couple of videos, or their homework videos, or the date that lies in her screen.
But today, we're creating incredibly wealthy digital archives that will live in unfamiliar areas as long as we die.
I think this creates an incredibly intriguing opportunity for technology.
To be clear, I'm a journalist, not a technologist, so I'd like to focus on what the present and the future are going to be like.
We're already seeing some of the services that allow us to explain what happens to our online profiles and accidents in the nets after our death.
One of them, for a long time, found me on a check in a New York restaurant on Foursquare.
(Applause) Adam: Hi.
Death: Adam?
E: Yeah.
Death: Death can destroy you anywhere at any time, even in Alaska.
E: Who is that?
"Death: ""When I'm going to die.net"" until it became too familiar."
(Laughter) A: Judicial, isn't it true?
This service makes a rather simple thing: make a message or a video that can be published on Facebook after you die.
The second service is called 1,000 memories.
It's going to let it online give you the right thing and fill it with videos and videos and stories that they can publish after you die.
But more than that, it's interesting.
Many of you have probably heard about David Roy, who's ever imagined how he's able to analyze over 90,000 hours of home video.
I think with the greater capacity of machines to understand human language and to develop massive volumes of data, it's going to be possible to analyze content throughout life — tweets, photographs, videos, blogs — that we produce in large numbers.
And I think as soon as that happens, for our digital institutions, it will be possible to continue collaborating with the real world after our death, thanks to the content that we've created, and the ability of technology to make that sense.
Now we're going to look at a couple of experiments.
There's a service like this, my next Twitter, and it's analyzing all your textbooks on Twitter, everything you've sent, and making predictions that you can write the next one.
As you can see, the outcome can be stone.
Imagine what something like this is going to look like in five, 10 or 20 years with a higher technology capacity.
By doing a step further, the MIT lab media is working on robots that can be treated as humans.
And if the work could be found on the basis of the unique characteristics of a particular person, hundreds of thousands of units of content that a person created in his lifetime.
Finally, remember the famous images at the night of the U.S. elections in 2008, when CNN was broadcast by the Will.I. Am's hip-hop voice for an interview with Anderson Cooper.
And what if we could use this technology to simulate the amount of our loved ones in our mind, generating very realistic, based on the content they created when they lived?
I think that's completely possible, because the data that we've created and the technology ability to analyze it is increasing in geometric pragmatism.
As a result, I think we all need to think, do we want it to be real? And if that means to understand life and what's going on.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The other exception is from the head of government.
Unfortunately, the answer to these questions is yes.
After that, you can do memories and test them.
What do we know about complex systems?
It turns out that the normal system doesn't consist of its parts.
Where are social networks?
We've scanned on massive networks.
The quality of the services is established.
"How are they organized?"" "Are they self-assembling?""
These are companies that work in more than one country, and there are 43,000.
Let me explain the analogy.
In a simple way, I want to argue that it's not the way we choose about love.
I don't know what you want to do, but when I imagine this metaphor, I see a cartoon stage — like this guy, he goes on the walk, doesn't mind, he goes to the person who's left, and the film goes into the channel.
And I think that's exactly the way, because it's not going to accelerate.
The distribution is sudden and uncontrollable.
It's something that happens to us without our permission.
I'm a teacher, and I'm also a teacher of English language, which means, in terms of words, I'm making my life.
You can say, and I'd like to find out that a lot of the metaphor that we use to talk about love is to have even a lot of them have a problem.
So in love, we fall.
We're angry.
We're scattered.
We fall in tiredness.
We're remembering from the fire.
Love makes us precious, and it makes us sick.
Our hearts see, and then they break down.
So, our metaphor causes someone's obsession with overweight or disease.
(Laughter) That's exactly how.
And they define us as the four unprecedented and unprecedented tools.
"My favorite one of them is ""smitten,"" which comes out of the past form of the word ""smite."" And if you look at the meaning of that word in the dictionary — (Laughter) you see what I mean is, and it means, and it's going to be very hot."" As a rule, I refer to the word ""smite"" with a very famous context, with the Old West."
"So there are 16 sentences to the word ""dead,"" which is used in the Bible for the resurrection of God."
(Laughter) We use the same words to think about love that we explain in our morning. (Laughter)
Right?
How did that happen?
How did we get to treat love with severe pain and pain?
And why do we take care of this kind of good experience, how would we be alive?
These are tough questions, but I have a few theories.
And to illuminate that, I want to focus on one concrete metaphor that reflects love as dignity.
When I first started studying romantic love, I approached these metaphors of dignity all over the world.
In the history of Western culture, there's a lot of languages that bring love to psychic disease.
Here's a couple of examples.
For the first time, I ended up 20 years old, and it was a pretty unpleasant relationship with the beginning.
These were relationships of distance for the first few years, so for me, it meant very high distances and low landings.
I personally remember one moment.
I was sitting on a bed in a hotel in South America, and I saw my coffee shop coming out of the door.
It was known, it was almost entirely, and we did the exercise, and when we went back to our care, he left his stuff in the bag and pulled out.
Even though I don't remember the opportunity of this argument anymore, I remember very clearly how his source saw.
I was 22, and it was my first grandfather in the developing world, and I was completely one.
I stayed a week before my flight home, and I knew the name of the Soviet Union in which it was, and the name of the Soviet Union that I needed to spend to get out, but I had no idea how to focus on.
I didn't have a final grandfather, and I didn't have much money, and I didn't know Spanish.
Somebody more courageous than I could calculate it as a moment of opportunity, but I got cold.
I just sat there.
And then she was crying.
"But despite my panic, some little voice in my head thought, ""You. It was dramatic."
"I'm really kidding rightly."" (Laughter) Because some part of me wanted to feel uncomfortable in love."
Now it sounds so strange to me, but at 22, I started to have dramatic experiments, and at that point I was unreasonable, angry and devastated, and it was quite strange, but I thought it was kind of a little bit about my feelings to a boy who just left me.
I think at a certain level, I wanted to be a little bit cool, because I thought, that's how love works.
"It doesn't really have to be surprising, assuming that there are eight films on Wikipedia, 14 songs, two albums, and one novel called ""The Great Love."" After about eight hours, he went back to our mind."
We've measured.
But calling someone like this — as if my experience was entirely dependent on the collection of love — was not very good for me or for him.
But I believe that this type of love is not very unusual.
Most of us feel a little bit of embarrassing at the early stage of the incision.
In fact, there's an assumption that tells us that it's normal, because neuroscience tells us that locomotion and psychic disorder is not so easy to differentiate.
That's true.
This study in 1999 uses blood tests to make sure that the rate of serotonin in order to fit is very similar to the rate of serotonin in people with the average-compulsive disorder.
(Laughter) Yeah, and the rate of serotonin is also associated with the syndrome of seasonal activity disorder and depression.
So there's a few evidence that love is closely related to the changes of our mood and behavior.
And other studies suggest that most relationships start this way.
Researchers argue that low levels of serotonin are related to an openness thinking about the object of love that reminds the feeling of someone sitting in your mind.
And most of us feel like this when we first fall in love.
I decided that if my siblings can't understand my mountaintosh, I don't need their friendships.
So I stopped confronting most of them.
And it was probably the most recent year in my life.
But I think I felt that being an instant was my job, because if I was an instant, then I would be able to tell you how powerful I could call him.
And if I could prove that, then we would eventually stay together.
It's a real virtue, because there's no universal rule that constitutes that a big package leads to great recognition, but we decide about love as if it's true.
Our experience of love is biological and cultural.
Our biology says that love is good by controlling the circle of knowledge in our brains, and it assumes that love sees when, after a breakthrough or a breakthrough, neuromicity changes.
Finally — you've probably heard about it — talking about neuroscience, living just like getting cocaine out of the box that I find total.
(Laughter) Then our culture uses language to fashion and serve these ideas of love.
In this case, we're talking about the metaphors of pain, dependence and dignity.
It's a pretty interesting feedback boom.
Love is powerful and sometimes visible, and we see it through our words and our stories, but then our words and our stories allow us to wait for a strong and loving love.
What's interesting about this is that it's all happening in a culture that loves living magnetism.
We want to be in the beginning and in the future of love, and we want to keep my life long.
It sounds ugly.
(Laughter) In order to control this, we need to either change our culture or change our expectations.
Imagine that we would all be less passionate about love.
If we were more confident, more open to another, more sophisticated, and instead of falling in love, we would have entered it.
I know it takes a lot of stuff, but I'm not the first person to offer it.
"In the book ""The Metaphors we live,"" the linguists Mark Johnson and George Lakeff suggest an interesting solution to this dilemma: we need to change our metaphors."
They report, and they can even recognize as the leaders of our future work, as the practices that work.
Johnson and Leakaf are proposing a new metaphor for love: Love as a successful creative culture.
I really love this way of understanding love.
The linguists say that metaphors support logic, which is essentially a way to see all the concepts, or ideas that are preserved in metaphors.
Johnson and Leakeef talk about all the things that education on the work of the arts produces: exile, compromise, perseverance, general goals.
These ideas are good for our cultural inclusion in long-term romantic relationships, but they also work well in other kinds of coherence — short-term, random, free, unimaginable, unstable — because these metaphors bring our more complex ideas to experience someone else's love.
So, if love is a successful creation of culture, then love is an aesthetic experience.
Love is unprecedented, love is private, love requires authorization and diplomacy, disappointing and winning empathy.
And love is made up of asthma and pain.
After all, every experience of love is different.
When I was younger, I never thought that you could not accept anything that love offered.
When a quarter-year-old Juliet first met — or if a quarter-year-old Juliet couldn't be without the Ramsey, which she met four days ago, she wasn't upset or excited.
Where is it?
She wants to die.
Right?
And as an applause, at the date of the five, the third of the five, Romo is not going to die.
He's alive, he's healthy, he's just thrown out of the city.
I understand that the 16th century Veronica is not similar to modern North America, but when I first read this song, as I was 14 years old, it made sense for me.
Paramounting love as something that I create with someone I love, not what just happens to me without my control or consent, it gives me an internal power.
But it's still hard.
Love at the very last time is absolutely irrelevant and subtle, and if I feel embarrassed, I have to remind myself that my job in these relationships is to talk to my partner about what I want to do together.
It's also a little bit.
But it's better than the second option in which love is dignity.
It's a version of love that's not about acceptance or loss of attention.
Instead, it requires trusting another partner and measuring the situation when believing becomes difficult, that it feels very simple, but in fact, revolutionary radioactive action.
Because you need to stop thinking about yourself and your achievements or losses in those relationships, and start thinking that you can offer.
"This version of love allows us to tell things like, "Hey, we're not very good educators. Let's not do it for us.""
"Because, ""These relationships were the punishment that I was planning, but still that was wonderful."" The great work of the society is good that he doesn't paint or miss himself."
This version of love will allow us to explain what anion will look like.
Thank you.
(Applause)
On the Sunday of '95s, I was still a student with my friend driving a car from the Provedans Republic, which is in the state of Rod Island, to the Republic of Portland, which is in Arizona.
You know how it happens when you're young and you're unemployed — we didn't go to highways, the north of the national parks, the local roads, the cars, say, the longest way.
One week in South Dakota, after 3,000 miles, I went back to my friends and I asked about what was going to be 3,000 miles away.
"What's the hierarchy that's all over the way?""
Her eyes came out on the boat.
The gift that you sit in the other world is very accurate now is her expression to the person.
"(Laughter) I'm here to her, ""You know, these signs along the way, which is Chinese English."" She's going to end up with me for a few more moments, and then she's laughing, because she finally understands."
That's what I am about.
(Laughter) That's him, this famous iconic place for peak. (Laughter)
In the last five years, I've been thinking a lot about exactly these things — why we sometimes listen to the signs of anger, and how we behave when unconsciousness appears, and what we all understand about human nature.
In other words, I've spent the last five years thinking about the state of hearing.
My career design may seem unusual to you, but it has a huge advantage: the absence of competition to work.
(Laughter) Now most of us would be willing to run away from thinking about our ignorance, or if anyone would try not to think about the loneliness of their disability.
It's abstract that we understand.
We understand that sometimes everybody in this room is thinking.
We are people, we have the power to think about it. Good, let's.
But when it comes to me, at this point, my translates in this data time, suddenly all the abstract views of human ability to read more, and I can't realize that I'm thinking.
What's interesting is that we live in this data time.
In them, we go to school, and they eat vaccines, and they go to the clouds and give our voice.
In practice, it turns out that we're all moving through life in a way of believing that we always have the right.
That seems to me a problem.
In my view, it's a problem both of each of us, on a personal or professional level, and we're all together as a society.
What I want to tell you today is the first assumption, because we're obsessed with the feeling of our right.
Secondly, that's why this approach is problematic.
And finally, I want to convince you that it's possible to get out of the shark of this feeling, and if you add it, it's the best of all the ways to jump into marality, intelligence and creativity that you can do.
So why are we keeping ourselves in our hearing?
It's one of the things that's associated with hearing unheard.
Let me try, maybe you, because you're going to see here. What are emotions occurring if you're not right?
ability. Incredible.
Compassion. Good, good, good, super.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you
"You say to the question, ""What feeling makes sense that you're not right?""
(Laughter) Understanding your mind will make you feel what it was said, and the whole spectrum, right?
For example, it could be a terrible feeling, whether it could be a sense of deepening consciousness, or even a happy feeling like my stupid Chinese ideology.
But the state of ignorance itself doesn't make any sense.
So here's an analogy.
Do you remember a cartoon company called the Moon Цunes, where such a missionary plane is running all the time, but it's not a running wheelchair?
But in every episode of this series, it turns out that it's driving behind the prison, and it's running out of the vertical rock that's wrong, because the fire is a bird, and it's going to fly.
But every time the boat flies out of the rock, it's now a little bit more than that.
What's funny, especially if you're only six years old, is that it's also hard for a car.
He just keeps running until he's looking at the bottom and realizing what he's going on in the wind.
That's when he starts falling.
If we're thinking about something, not if we realize we're thinking about it, but by that, we're kind of like this car, after the rock, but we're looking down.
You know, we've already been thinking, we're still getting to deal with it, but we still feel confident in the world.
I need a little bit to translate what I've ever said.
There's a sense of being unheard — it's a sense of being right.
(Laughter) Because of this structural argument, we're never ever connected to the sense of our rights.
I'm going to call this idea blind.
Mostly, we don't have a whole mechanism that would suggest if we're wrong until we know.
There's another reason why we're experiencing this feeling, and it's more about culture.
Imagine a little start school.
You're your own neighbors, and the teacher's convinced that they're controlled, and one of them looks like this.
Now, that's not me.
(Laughter) So you're in your school, and you know exactly what to think about a classmate who's given that kind of note.
He's stupid and stupid, he's never doing homework.
So, by the age of nine, you've learned that, first of all, those who start thinking are left-hand, back-hand buttons, and second of all, in order to succeed in life, you can never start thinking.
We're learning these bad words a lot more human.
Most of us, and as I think, especially in this room, are getting to this kind of learning, being done by unbelievable qualities, perfectionists, stagnants.
Isn't it, the CEO of finance, the same as an astrophysic, he's a super marathon?
(Laughter) As it turns out, you're all such educators, astrophysics and marathonists.
Let's be.
The situation is worse only when we're making it that we're, on the right hand, in something.
Because when we think about it, when we make a mistake, we say something is not the same with us.
So we keep on our own, because that's how we feel rational, accountable, accessible and protected.
Let me tell you about the accident.
A few years ago, at the hospital of the name of Matt Israel Jizzone, they took a woman to do it.
This hospital is located in Boston.
In this hospital, a Harvard student's practice is one of the best students in the country.
This woman was taken and taken into the business room.
She's put under the drug, and the surgeon manipulates it, and then he takes it and lawyers it in the post-operative room.
And I think it's gone normal.
"The woman begins, she looks at herself and says, ""Why am I not connected to that sight?"" And she's connected to that sight, because the surgeon did a serious injection on her left-hand side rather than on her right."
And when he said about this donation by the letter as a processor, he said something very interesting.
"""In an unconscious case, the surgeon simply felt that he was working on the right eye."" (Laughter) Why I'm talking about it, because believing in your sense of being in the right face of something might be very dangerous."
This inner feeling of our hearing that we always feel is impossible to believe as the only question of what's actually happening in the call world.
And if we're in our behaviors based only on this insight, and we don't even think about the optimism of our intelligence, we're doing stupidity, like eradicating 11 million liters of oil in the hall of Mexico, or the neutral global economy.
It's a giant problem for practice.
But it's also a giant problem for society.
Think for a minute what it means to hear your rights.
That means that your beliefs of hearing distort reality.
And with this feeling, the extraordinary problem is to explain to all those people that you're uncomfortable with.
And it turned out that most of us would explain to ourselves people with different attitudes using passwords.
The first thing that we usually think, if somebody with us disagree, is that we assume that they're not satisfied with data.
They simply don't have access to the information that you have, and if you're a bit of this information that you share with them, they're going to come and they're going to go to your camp.
If that doesn't happen, if we prove that they share the same facts with us, but continue to not mention with us, we move to the other point of view, which is that they are ideas.
(Laughter) They're in front of them all the supplies they need, and they're crazy, they can't get it more.
And if it doesn't work, if we understand that people who don't talk about us have the same facts, and yet they're quite reasonable, we're going to go to the third statement — they know the truth, but for their bad questions, the meaning of truth is overcoming.
This is a disaster.
And that's our advantage of deconstructing our rules that doesn't allow us to make mistakes, especially when it's time-to-day, and it makes us feel hard to happen each other.
What I'm more likely to become a stand, I think it's tragic, which is a situation that's abundant to find out of our human being.
To be, we want to believe that our minds are these unbelievable breakthroughs that we can see them all over time and adapt the whole world.
And we want everybody to look after the lights through the same glass, and see exactly the same thing.
It's not true, and if it was, the world would be incredibly boring.
The heart of our mind is not that we can see the world that it is.
It's that we can see the world not as it is.
We can have a sense of being, understanding the future, and we can imagine that we are other people in other places.
Especially because everyone sees a little bit differently, we can look at that same cable in the middle of the sky and see that, and that, and that, and that.
And that's why we're thinking.
"In 1,200 years before David wrote his famous words, ""I think I mean exist,"" a comment from the name of Saint Augustine wrote ""fallor 360 sum,"" "I'm thinking and knowing exists.""
The Augustine realized that the fact that we were willing to think about it was not an unintelligent effect in human systems, not something for prevention or destruction.
It's the basis of our human beings.
Because we're not God, we don't really know what's going on in this world.
Unlike other animals, we're constantly trying to capture this world.
I think it's an infinite devotion — it's a cortex, and the flow is all about our products and our creative imagination.
"When I was flying, in different ways, I started listening to a lot of releases of ""This American Life"" on the public radio."
I listened, I listened, and I began to feel that all the conversations were about listening.
"I first thought, ""I got excited."
Now, I'm always, as a joke, seeing unheard.
"It seems to me everywhere."" There was a lot of compassion."
But over the course of a few months, I had the privilege to get an interview in the cross-border school with the Air Voice.
"I shared this talk with them, and he said to me, ""This is actually this."
He's shown that the creativeists even joke that in every release, this is the most sophisticated theme.
"She said, ""I thought this thing was going to happen like this, and it turned out to be different."" ""What's interesting?"" And I said, ""Well, the thing that we need is information like this."
"We need these moments of misunderstanding and change of misunderstanding to make these stories clear."" What all of us, the authors, as listeners or readers, are telling us stories like this."
We're looking at changing the site, making the steps and failing the ends.
What happens to our stories is that we're going to start thinking about it.
But you know that our stories are, because our lives are.
We think it's going to happen, and it's going to seem different.
George Bush thought he was attacking Iraq, going to come up with weapons of mass destruction, liberating people and supporting the 5th Middle East.
And the first thing happened was different.
But also, Hosni Mubarak thought he would be the dictator of Egypt to the end of his life, until he'd matched and spread, and then he could transfer the power to his son.
And the first thing happened was different.
Maybe you've ever thought that you're going to stand up and get stuck with your school, come back to your family and figure out how many kids together.
And the first thing happened was different.
I have to admit that I thought I was writing the most recent book about something that nobody had a job, for readers that would never be.
And the first thing happened was different.
(Laughter) It's the same life.
We're developing incredible ideas about the extraordinary world, sometimes it's better, sometimes it's not, and the world is growing and teaching us.
Don't worry about it, but all this convention exists as a memory of our courage to think about it.
We've ever dedicated a whole week to talks about innovation, acceleration and transformation, but you know why do we need these innovations, improvements and recycling?
Because the gender of ideas that were most interesting and had the opportunity to change the world — look at TED in 1998, what's there?
(Laughter) didn't work, isn't that? (Laughter)
Where's my poster, Chris? (Laughter)
(Applause) And we're here again.
And that's how it will continue.
We're going to come up with another idea.
We're going to tell you another story.
We're going to join another conference.
The theme of today, as you've heard seven million times, is how to find beauty again.
"And I think, if you want to find beauty again, then go beyond this little girl and fear the space of your right and look at each other, and look at the infinity, the simplicity and the mystery of a friend and let yourself say, ""I don't know."
"I can think about it."" Thank you."
(Applause) Thank you all. (Applause)
The 5th of the 1990s, a man named El-Saiid Nasar went into the hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi of Maryханé, the leader of the League of Civil Defense.
In the early days, Narrator was recognized as innocent in the battle, but by organizing a generation for other crimes, he and his collaborators started planning attacks on a number of New York celebrities, including the panels, the synagogue and the headquarters of the United Nations.
Fortunately, these plans were designed by the FBI's infirmers.
But unfortunately, the explosion in 1993 in the World Trade Center didn't make any difference.
In the case of Natanah, you're going to be able to do it.
El-Sad Nasar is my father.
I met in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, in a family of an Egyptian engineer and a clapping American mother, primary school teachers, and parents together forced my childhood to be happy.
But when I was seven years old, the relationship in our family began to change.
My father showed me the same way to Islam that had to be allowed to see, including even most Muslims.
My experience shows that when people meet each other, they don't need a lot of time to realize that in general, we all love each other and the same.
In every religion, in every generation, there's a small percentage of people who are so spontaneously supportive of their beliefs that they feel the need to use any means to allow others to live under their rules.
In a couple of months before the last father sent me and told me that several of the last weekends, he and his friends went to London Island for a coach.
He said the next morning I'm going to go with him.
We went to Calverton Street, which the FBI was on the left.
On that day, my last shot hit a little plant lamp upside down the city, and, to all sorts of excitement, and especially my, all the way, the flooded.
"My grandfather came back to friends and said in Arabic, ""Evan Abou."" Who's the father, who is the son."
And they've all learned this forever very strongly, but only a few years later, I've fully understood its meaning.
They saw me the same reduction that my father was.
In the result of these people, they're responsible for the crash of a van that was charged by families with kilograms of explosion in the underground park on the north side of the World Air Force, and when the explosion led to the death of six people, the wounds received more than a thousand.
These were the men I grew up on.
"These people, I called ""am,"" which means ""done.""
Every time I started to feel comfortable in one place, it's time for me to bring things to a different place.
When I was always a new person in class, I was often a human being.
I've been taught to punish people on the basis of cases such as religion or race.
So what opened my eyes?
The first thing that ended up with this image of thinking happened during the 2000 government elections.
Through the next program, I've been able to replicate in the U.S. exile in Philadelphia.
The members of our community have produced the most diverse layers of society.
One day, closer to the end of the journey, I found that one of my new friends was a big deal.
I had never had friends of the clouds before, and frankly, I became convinced that there was a great barrier that I believed almost all my life.
Another breakthrough was a summer project at Bush 360, and it was a park of attraction.
That's where I saw people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures, and this experience was fundamental in the rise of my own education.
Part of the crops that I've been living in my childhood have come to me with the sense of empathy for other people, and it's not natural for me to get to other good people as I would like to get to me.
This experience allowed me to compare the stereotypes that I was taught as a child with life experiences.
And then it was the daily Show. Every night, John Stewart made me feel honest with myself because of my own fanatism, and helped me understand that race, religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of learning.
In many ways, he replaced me the father that I needed so much.
It's often coming from where you don't expect it at all, and now I understand that the baby video influenced my view of light more efficiently than my father-examinist.
I just talked to my mother about how my view of light began to change, and she told me something that I would keep my whole life in my heart.
At this point, I realized how much negative energy it takes to maintain that uncertainty within itself.
Because Ibrahim is not my real name.
I took him when my family decided to open up relationships with my parents and start a new life.
Why am I going to open up my partner and potentially challenge myself?
Well, that's simple.
Instead of doing that, I use my experience in the fight against terrorism, in the fight against fanatism.
I do this for the benefits of terrorism and for their relatives, for the terrible pain and the loss that caused terrorism.
In the memory of the benefits of terrorism, I'm talking about these unacceptable decisions, and I'm asking my father's actions.
I'm standing here as a proof that violence is not an unacceptable part of religion or race, and that the son is not bound to keep his father's way.
I'm not my father.
Thank you. (Applause) Thank you all. (Applause) Thank you all. (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause)
But it can't be that way.
I'm the one who loves chocolate dots.
I've learned so much through these 30-day experiments.
This is the inspiration from my experiment when I did after the text every day of the month.
I've never been touched by the stories.
She's terrified.
They're the most powerful.
(Applause)
I was incredibly excited to be born in a country which is considered the best places in the world to be a woman.
In 1975, when I was seven years old, women in Iceland came out to a vacation.
They didn't work that day, regardless of whether they had a job or just a homework.
They went on Mars at Lake Lake City — 90 percent of women enrolled — and slowly and in solidarity asked about growth.
Nothing worked in Iceland that day, because nothing works when women don't.
(Applause) In five years, Icelanders had the opportunity to become the new country in the world that, in a political way, chose a woman as a president.
I'm never going to forget that day when President Westis, who we know in our name, went to the balcony of his house, the mother of the girl with her daughter, after his fight.
(Applause) It became an incredible model for me and anyone who grew up at the time, including boys.
"She often talked about a story about a boy who came to her after a few sentences on the trip, and she said, ""Well, how can boys also become president when they grow up?"" (Laughter) The role models are mostly meaningful, but even with such powerful views to read, which I'm very confident when I was invited to go to the president's seat, my other reaction was, "Who am I like to go to this journey?"
"Who am I to be a president?"" It turns out that women are less likely to test on the road than men."
A study conducted in the U.S. in 2011, showed that 62 percent of men saw their office on the president, but only 45 percent of women.
We see 16 percent breakthroughs, and that's the same breakthroughs that existed a decade ago.
It's a real shame, because I'm sure that this world needs women who are leaders, and it needs more education around us.
So my solution to ballot finally was that I felt I needed to do my input, even without any political effort, to go ahead and try to take a chance to create a world that would have a sense and a sense for our children, where we really allowed and for boys, and the girls to achieve what they wanted.
It was the journey of my entire life.
It was wonderful.
The journey started with 20 patents.
After graduation, the number came to nine candidates, and finally the race came to us four, three men and me.
(Applause) But it's not a drama yet.
By the way, you count that here in the U.S., there's drama, but I can — (Laughter) I can say that we're not the worst in Iceland.
First of all, the president of the last 20 years imagined that it wasn't going to fight, it was going to be, and it led to that amount of resources.
And then he thought, when our prime minister came back because of the sadness of the known Panama Papers that he and his family were involved in.
In Iceland, there was a popular protest, because when the president thought that the country needed a recognized leader.
And after a few days, his wife and her family were also introduced to the Panama Papers, and he went out of race again.
Before he was a son, he explained what he did, because there are now two qualified men who can become his annual passers.
So nine minutes, 45 days before the election, it didn't look too good for me.
I didn't even get a place in the newspaper graph.
According to a survey, I had one percent, but all of the things, it was the highest opportunity for women candidates.
It's going to be a change to say that I've got the idea of everything I've designed to get my place behind the steel and get to television, because the television has decided to include only two-and-a-half percent of the votes in the first debate.
On the day of these experiments, it turns out that I'm going to take over there with my husband's friends, and during the exercise, I learned that I got an acronym of 2.5 percent on the day of the first experiments.
(Applause) And the problems.
The fundamental problems that we had to confront and address on this path were related to media, support and play.
Let's start with media.
Some argue that gender doesn't matter for media and politics.
I can't do it.
I've been trying to get more access and more time in the AIDS.
In fact, the headquarters appeared in the local AIDS 87 times a few months before the election, while I appeared there 31 times.
And I'm not saying that media is doing this consciously.
I think there's an unconscious experience, because in the AIDS, in a large part, like everywhere, there's a conscious and unconscious presence, and we need to be able to talk about it when we want to reduce.
"When I finally got access to TV, the first question was, ""Do you plan to take your program off?"" It was a difficult question."
Now, with a fraction of one to 2.5 percent of the votes in the survey, you can understand it.
But AIDS has a significance, and every time I'm on TV, we've seen and felt improvement in the survey, so I don't know by hearing how important it is, and why we need to talk about it.
I had one of the four final candidates never had an interview in another room.
I've always been left because of the questions that all the rest of the government had done, and because of the light of the choices.
I've come up with this, but I'll tell you the Icelandic AIDS test.
It wasn't almost an immediate commentary about the opportunity of my weight or my hair.
(Applause) Let them be told.
But there's another very important experience.
I was treated as an independent lawyer, without any political support or support.
This lack of experience and access to resources may have gone through our company, but it also allowed us to bring new and do new policies differently.
Our campaign was effective, and so we may have changed the tone of choices for others.
I'm in this source of a smaller amount of time on TV, because I wanted to show attention to other performers.
When access to media is extremely complex, we've launched our own information.
I've been online on Facebook, and I've been responding to every question of the voters.
All of the questions that we received together with the answers, we put open access to Facebook because we believed the importance of communication when you wanted to get trust.
When I found myself problematic to take care of young entrepreneurs, I started using 18 percent.
So I asked me how to do that, and I used every filter in Microsoft during the last part of the company.
I've really got a lot of humor and pictures, because I'm a preacher here.
But because of that, we've grown a number of incentives per capita.
It turns out that it's possible to lead a campaign in a different way.
Unfortunately, you can't think about politics and you can't remember money.
The idea is that it's just like this, but it's true, and we had less financial resources than we had in other institutions.
By the way, the reason part was that, in my view, time was unreasonable to ask for public support.
And maybe I've tried to do more with smaller profits.
Some people will say it's much more painful.
But even with the waste of the AIDS and the public resources, and only with the entrepreneurship, but the wonderful team, we had to surprise everyone on the day of the election when the first numbers came.
I surprised myself as you can see in the video.
(Laughter) In the first data, I went through the lead documents.
(Applause) Well, too much wound, because I couldn't get through, but I took another place, and we went a long way from one point to almost a third of the voices, and instead of looking at an unprecedented breakthrough, the outcome was 10 percent bigger than the last survey.
Because of that, some people would call me the real voters of elections, and a lot of people forced me to talk again.
But in fact, I'm going to get the message that I've gotten a pretty much higher response to support from 2050, and a lot of people have arrested my daughter to speak back in 2040s.
(Applause) Now she's 13, and she's never on TV.
But on the day of the election, I just saw her on TV, she was smart, confident, she was honest and she supported her mother.
By the way, it was the most powerful moment in my company.
(Applause) But there was another one.
In the early days, girls of high school saw my posture on an autonomous approach and made it necessary to pick up.
Audience: Oh!
This idea is already a victory for me.
We can achieve what we see.
It's about fear and problems.
(Applause) Women in governance need, and it's time for women to talk about whether it's a gender director or a president.
"I've also learned to introduce your hometown magazine, New Yorker, and I've had a new title: ""The real dream of being honest."" (Applause) Now, it's probably my most popular title, because women are too often punishing for the benefit of emotional capital as I call it, but I know from the fact that we're just going to win when we do that."
(Applause) And we need to use it more.
On the day of elections, we celebrated, we would be overwhelmed, because that's how we felt ourselves.
It's not necessary to get to that path.
You just have to go to that, and you, your family and your siblings, all who are going to work with you, if you send a good job, you're going to grow higher than anything you've experienced.
We've done a good time, and I'm rich to learn about this journey, more than I can tell you about today's journey.
But be sure, it was a hard job.
I've slept very much in those months.
The courage and curiosity came together, so that I couldn't sit, and I finally realized what I knew on the other day of the talk: you're only going to be able to be able to listen to yourself honestly and agree with that personal voice.
As you protect my good sister, you can cheat your intuition, but intuition never deceives you.
I also want to follow, and you all know that, in any journey you go, the key thing is your team.
People have suggested that they share your values and your views, but they differ in a different way.
For me, it's a formula of success, and I'm blessed with the wonderful men who are here today, the incredible family — (Applause) and great friends, we came out as entrepreneurs on the political arena and found something, in words of people, impossible.
In fact, the main public service expert told me how I made a decision that would be good if I got 7 percent.
I looked at his point of view, because to imagine, he changed the right, and found his thought on a valuable experience.
But on one day, I decided to show you that he was thinking.
It's very important to recognize this, because I'm actually very little sleeping, and I worked very closely, as people would see with me.
We're never able to do a lot if we forget the question of ourselves.
I think there are two things that are really important about this: attacking yourself with people and things that enrich you, but not least important, if not more, to have the ability to take care of people and actions that pick up your enthusiasm, including wonderful bloggers and commentaries.
I was fully supported by others, and I decided not to pay attention to the projections, partly because my energy was caught at the time.
When I lost an energy at some point — and it took place over time, because it was a little bit — I looked at my thoughts about my causes to fight, not just like that, but by my rules.
I called our 4G campaign, where G means Icelandic words.
"The first of them is ""GEG."" I was talking to make a gift, to be comfortable, and I wanted the education as a service to be the institution of our work as we were in front of a company."
"The other word is ""Gleague,"" or happiness."
I decided to do this journey.
A lot of it could be taken, regardless of whether it was reached.
And I did all the designs to inspire others.
"The third word is ""Gagnsuoi."" I was open to all the questions."
I didn't have any advice, or anything could be found on Facebook or on our websites.
I think when you choose the sixth, you're worth asking your questions.
The least important word for a student, which you don't have to explain in this room, we're a big girlpower campaign, the female force.
(Applause) I'm incredibly happy that I've found the ability to fight to risk to fight, but to succeed at many levels.
I can't say it was simple, but I'm sure, and I think all of my team would agree, and it was worth it.
Thank you.
(Applause) Thanks. Thank you. (Applause)
Pat Mitchell: I don't leave you yet. Hall Thomaser: What good listeners are. PM: I can't leave you, I can't leave you.
That maybe everyone in this room is willing to go to Iceland and vote for you.
We're sure if we're going to have the right to vote there, but there's something that we can take in Iceland, like before, that's an inspiration.
I mean, it's old enough to remember 1975 when women in Iceland came out of school, and it really became a big fact for the launch of women's movement.
You've been sent to this event before, and let's go back to the video to imagine what a country looked like in the dark.
And you may not know, because the American AIDS didn't report about it, but the Icelandic women came back to school. Right?
LT: Yeah. PM: Can you tell us about this?
LT: 41 years since that vacation, we can be considered the best places in the world to be a woman, but our work hasn't done.
So in the middle, in 14.38, women in Iceland left their job, because that's what they're doing during that time.
(Applause) It was really good that young girls and boys were getting more than they had before, because it's time for the pay gap.
PM: I'm not going to try Hall now about her future plans, but I'm going to say you're going to have a great good army if you decide to do it again.
Thank you, Hall.
LT: Thank you all.
(Applause)
In fact, I tried to think about my career since I left the White House, and the best example I have is the New Yorker photo a couple of years ago.
"The little boy, looking at his father, would say, ""Dad, when I grow up, I want to be an ex-precedented."" (Laughter) I've had a great blessing as a president, because I've had access, which countless people in the world have ever had, to meet people in this world."
They're introducing these rules to convince that women tend to bring together societies in comparison to men in the eyes of God.
So they issued a sentence that essentially condemns women to be sacred, to be persuasive, to prevailing, to priesthood, or to priest in the army, when a woman learns in the South Bible class, she can't publish when a boy is in the room, because you can find the top of the Bible, and in the Bible, more than 30,000 times, where it's said that a woman shouldn't learn a man, and that's more.
But the key thing is that the songs are misinterpreted to keep men in a higher position.
Why should I pay them the same reward for doing the same work?
In the U.S., for example, we've had a tremendous increase in the population of the poor, mainly in black people and minorities that have been planted in trouble.
Right now, 7.3 people out of 1,000 find themselves in the dark.
It's a symmetrical healing.
Since I left the White House, 800 percent of black women have been raised in the dark.
We're one of the many countries on Earth, which has a moderate generation, becoming a developed country.
We're in California right now, and I found out one day that California was spending four billion dollars to commit 13 people to death.
One of them is the selection of palace organs.
Sometimes, in more extraordinary cases, they get out of the hospital so that a girl can
And then when she's married, she's just the same time she's going to open the toilet so that she can do sex.
It's not a rare thing; it's also against the law.
In Egypt, for example, 91 percent of all women living in Egypt today were sexually filmed in this way.
In some countries, it's more than 98 percent of women who have been exposed to the rise.
It's a huge disaster for all the women living in these countries.
Another very serious thing is that a family with misinterpretation, there's nothing in the Koran that's going to tell you about it, will kill a girl from her family when she was raped or when she married or sometimes even when she's wearing her.
It's going to be a family member, so the family becomes a murderer when a girl comes to what's called shame in the family.
Not so long, an AIDS analysis was done in Egypt, and he showed that 75 percent of these crimes of girls were given to parents, to children or to brothers, 25 percent of the crimes of conduct to three women.
The other problem that exists in the world in women's education is slavery, or humankind, as it's now called.
About 12.5 million people were delivered to the New World in the 19th and 18th century.
Thirty million people live today in slavery.
The U.S. State Department has to do business every year, and the Federal Department reports, across international borders every year, 80 percent of those sentences — women that happen in sexual slavery.
In the United States right now, 60,000 people live underneath or in slavery.
Atlanta, Georgia, where Walter Carter is located, and where I'm going to go to the University ofмира, between 200 and 300 women, people.
It's the number one place in the state because of that.
There are also lots of passengers in Atlanta.
If a billion owner wants to buy a girl who has skills, they can do that in 1,000 dollars.
A white girl to bring the average bearman in Atlanta can earn about 35,000 dollars of slavery.
The SSG in Atlanta, Georgia.
That leads to one of the worst problems, women buy and sell in all countries in the world.
Sweden has a good way to do that.
About 15 to 15 years ago, Sweden decided to change the law, and women don't follow the law anymore, if they're in sexual slavery, but the owners of the billions, the creditors and — (Applause) — the education went down.
In the United States,
On one man, 25 women were sent to the U.S.
Canada, Ireland, I said, Sweden, France and other countries are moving now to this.
This is another thing that can be done.
We have two great schools in the state, our army and a great public system.
The arts are analyzed.
The last example I've received is that it's 26,000.
Only 3,000, many more than one percent, and the reason is that the commandor of any institution is a vehicle, like my submarine boat, or the crew in a march sand — the commandor has the right by law to decide about building a criminal situation, and, of course, the last thing they want is that under their command so they don't do that.
This law has to be changed.
The law enforcement says, in the state of the university campus, it's because because of the public system, when they rap someone, but when they find themselves in the public campus.
They're not investigating.
These are things that happen in our society.
When I became a president, the difference was 39 percent.
So we've got a certain pragmatism, and then further — (Applause) (Laughter) — but in the last 15 years, it's only about 23 or 24 percent of the difference in the last 15 years.
That's what's happening now.
When you take 500 campaigns, 23 of them are teachers, 500 of them, and these managers, I'll tell you, earn in the middle less than the rest of them.
That's what happens in our country.
One problem with the United States is that we're the most powerful country on Earth.
We've been in the state of Russia just since the Second World War.
Sometimes our soldiers were on the ground.
On the other hand, we flew over the balloons, putting bombs on people.
Sometimes, of course, we now have drones.
We were in the war with 25 different countries, or more after World War II.
Over the course of four and a half years, I'm not going to say who we didn't run — (Applause) — we didn't run any bombs, we didn't kill.
But in any case, these things, turning to violence and misinterpreting sacred sentences, are the fundamental causes of violence over women.
There's another fundamental reason why, Agul, men, to swim.
(Applause) That's the truth.
A typical man who can say, calmly taking the privilege, it's very similar to when I was young, when separation and growth came together.
But over the course of that time, there were a lot of white people who didn't think that disclosure was appropriate, but they did, because they were used by privilege of unique access to court courts of rich, better schools and everything else, and that's the same thing that exists today, because the ordinary man, in fact,
"In particular, when they say, ""I'm using them in favor of disclosure."
What's the basic thing we need to do today?
I would say, the best thing we could do for women who are powerful as this, and where you're born, Europe and so far, who have the impact has to take advantage of themselves to be more translated to end racial disclosure around the world.
But I hope that after this conference, women will communicate their men about collapses in college campus and in the arts and etc., and in the future of the labor market, they need to protect their daughters and their expectations.
I have 12 kids, four kids and 10 truthers, and I often think about them, and about the kind of situation, not only if they lived in Egypt to have equal rights, and I hope that all of you will come to me to be champions for women around the world and protect their human rights.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s, the future of the world seemed dead.
The rise of the government was not going to stop.
The global cold was unprecedented.
The cancer epidemic produced by chemicals in the environment was about to cut our lives.
The oxygen rain was floating over the forests.
The oil ended, and the nuclear stem would end us.
In my life expectancy, my average life expectancy increased by 30 percent.
A decade of rotation has changed by two thirds.
Creating food per capita has grown by a third.
The death of a little bit on the graph shows the death of the city, and this graph shows the GDP per capita of the city.
In other words, you need to understand how ideas come to sex.
I want you to figure out how we went from creating these objects to creating these objects.
Now there were some changes, but the rule changed more than the skeleton at that time.
It's a phenomenon, but it's a truth.
Whereas it's about five years old.
And more than that, with a lot of different ideas, plastic ideas, laser ideas, transistors ideas.
They were connected together in this technology.
And it's a combination, it's a collective technology that intrigues me, because I think it's the key to understanding what's happening in the world.
My body is also a collection of ideas: the idea of boring cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of black cells.
They came together.
How do evolution do something generalizing or connected?
It's using pallified intelligence.
It's about another survivor.
In terms of palliative intelligence, it's possible that the subject gets into the inheritance of mutation on different lines.
So sex allows people to innovate genetic innovations of all kinds of ways.
It's not limited to personal nature.
What process has the same effect in cultural revolution that sex has in biological evolution?
And I think the answer is a matter, a lot of change in one thing to another.
It's a unique human rice.
The water animal doesn't do that.
It can be this assexual culture.
In empathy, there is culture.
They learn one of the other experiences that are transmitted from their parents to our neighbors.
The games of chimps have different cultures in different games.
There's no idea change among them.
Why does change increase the standard of life?
The evidence came from David Richard in 18 17.
Let me write his opinion in the version of the Stone Age, which he also explained in the laws of law between countries.
Adam produces a wild in four hours and a sonar in three hours.
Oz produces a wild in one hour and a sensor in two hours.
It's better than Adam in production and sugar and wonder.
I don't need Adam.
He's able to do his own holes and grains.
Adam and Oz came up for an hour of their time.
When you start first, you have to go to the village.
How much of it is about you? It took a lot of time.
How much do you get to work for an hour of nightlight to read if you're in the average income in Britain?
The object on the right was made for me by other people.
How exactly did a person do it?
Ten? Hundreds? Thousands?
You can see, I think, millions.
And that's how society works.
That's what we've achieved as biological from.
In the old hours, when you were rich, people were literally working on you.
498 people were feeding him a night every day.
In fact, there are other animals working each other.
Murder is a classic example.
Caravilla is responsible for growth.
(Applause) When did these behaviors start?
But I have no evidence of that.
And the beauty of this system is that it benefits both eyes.
And the man knows that he doesn't need to get caught in order to have a career.
They were highly cooperative.
They were very intelligent.
But there's no evidence that they had jobs.
There's no evidence of all women.
It seems that women were burning together with men.
But there's no evidence of change between groups, because one of the foundations of the subjects, the tools they've done, is always made out of local institutions.
For example, there's a place in Cairo where there's been local non-entrals that have been invented.
They're always made of local chemistry.
When people start to change things in these ways, it's proof that they're changing between groups.
Mandela is 10 times older than agriculture.
And the early report of this discovery was about 80,000 years ago in Africa, where we see that obsession, jaw and other objects are about huge distances from Ethiopia.
Now, cancer — as it was invented here, in Oxford — went 200 kilometers of a massacre from the Mediterranean Algeria.
And that's the evidence that groups of people started to change.
And that led to publicity.
What happens when you prevent people from changing, from being able to change and personalizate?
And the evidence is that it's not only going to disrupt the technology прагars, but it can even turn it into an alternative.
The example of this is Tasmanian.
The Tasmanians were isolated.
So let's go back to discover and try, not just who did this and for whom, but who knew how to do it?
No one, no one.
"And I'm probably the famous essay of Leonardo Reed, the philosopher of the 1950s, called ""I, the Elephant,"" in which he wrote, how an animal is produced, and that nobody knows how to make an animal, because people in the classmen don't know how to make a graph, and they don't know how to grow trees and everything like that."
What we've done in modern society, in ways of changing and engineering, is we've created the ability to do things that we don't even understand.
It's not the same thing in language.
Now, so I'm not interested in the research on intellectual quality, or they have higher IQ groups than other groups.
That absolutely doesn't matter.
In society, it matters how good people communicate their ideas, and how good they cooperate, not how smart one person is.
We've created the brain.
We're just nodes in the retina.
We are the neurons of this brain.
All of a sudden, finding and mixing ideas is one of the right technology прагars, step by step.
But you're also getting weird things.
In the future, as we move forward, we're going to have terrible things.
It's war, depression, natural catastrophe.
The terrible things happen in this century, I'm absolutely confident.
Thank you.
(Applause)
